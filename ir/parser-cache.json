Most historians consider it to have been a thought experiment rather than a physical test as there is little evidence that it actually took place.[6] ",

                "content": "At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies of the same material falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed.[3]:20 This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to their weight.[3]:9[7] While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is accepted by most historians that it was a thought experiment which did not actually take place.[8][9] An exception is Stillman Drake, who argues that it took place, more or less as Viviani described it, as a demonstration for students.[3]:19–21, 414–416 Galileo set out his ideas about falling bodies, and about projectiles in general, in his book Two New Sciences. The two sciences were the science of motion, which became the foundation-stone of physics, and the science of materials and construction, an important contribution to engineering. Galileo arrived at his hypothesis by a famous thought experiment outlined in his book On Motion.[10] This experiment runs as follows: Imagine two objects, one light and one heavier than the other one, are connected to each other by a string. Drop this system of objects from the top of a tower. If we assume heavier objects do indeed fall faster than lighter ones (and conversely, lighter objects fall slower), the string will soon pull taut as the lighter object retards the fall of the heavier object. But the system considered as a whole is heavier than the heavy object alone, and therefore should fall faster. This contradiction leads one to conclude the assumption is false. ",

The experiment is described in Simon Stevin's book De Beghinselen der Weeghconst (The Principles of Statics), published in 1586 and a landmark book on statics: 'Let us take (as the highly educated Jan Cornets de Groot, the diligent researcher of the mysteries of Nature, and I have done) two balls of lead, the one ten times bigger and heavier than the other, and let them drop together from 30 feet high, and it will show, that the lightest ball is not ten times longer under way than the heaviest, but they fall together at the same time on the ground. (...) This proves that Aristotle is wrong.' [11][12][13] Astronaut David Scott performed a version of the experiment on the Moon during the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, dropping a feather and a hammer from his hands. Because of the negligible lunar atmosphere, there was no drag on the feather, which hit the ground at the same time as the hammer. ",

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. ",

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction ",

On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] ",

                "content": "Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) ",

The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] ",

However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] ",

The first building constructed at Campo dei Miracoli, Pisa, was the cathedral, or Duomo di Pisa, which rests on a white marble pavement and is an impressive example of Romanesque architecture. Square of Miracles, Baptistery The next building added was the baptistery just west of the dome.Then work on the campanile began. Before the work on the campanile was completed the cemetery, Campo Santo, was built. Piazza dei Miracoli of Pisa is the most splendiferous assemblage of Romanesque architecture in Italy. Faced in gray-and-white striped marble and bristling with columns and arches, the cathedral, with its curiously Islamic dome and matching domed baptistery, rises from an emerald green lawn. Flanking one side of the piazza, the camposanto, or cemetery, is a gracefully elongated cloister enclosing a burial ground with earth reputedly brought back during the Crusades from Golgotha, the hill where Jesus was crucified, so that noble Pisans could rest in holy ground.

Although only a third as high as the Washington Monument, it was a miracle of medieval engineering, probably the tallest bell towers in Europe. With 207 columns ranged around eight stories, Tower of Pisa looks like a massive wedding cake knocked precariously askew by a clumsy giant guest. The construction of Tower of Pisa began in August 1173 and continued for about 200 years due to the onset of a series of wars. Till today, the name of the architect is a mystery. Leaning Tower of Pisa and CathedralThe leaning Tower of Pisa was designed as a circular bell tower that would stand 185 feet high. It is constructed of white marble. The tower has eight stories, including the chamber for the bells. Leaning-Tower of Pisa The bottom story consists of 15 marble arches. Each of the next six stories contains 30 arches that surround the tower. The final story is the bell chamber itself, which has 16 arches. There is a 297 step spiral staircase inside the tower leading to the top. The top of the leaning tower of Pisa is about 17 feet off the vertical. The tower is also slightly curved from the attempts by various architects to keep it from leaning more or falling over. Many ideas have been suggested to straighten the Tower of Pisa, including taking it apart stone by stone and rebuilding it at a different location. In the 1920s the foundations of the tower were injected with cement grouting that has stabilized the tower to some extent. Until recent years tourists were not allowed to climb the staircase inside the tower, due to consolidation work. But now the leaning Tower of Pisa is open again and it is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Italy → Book a Hotel or check our → Visit Tower of Pisa page. ",

Si tratta di un campanile a sé stante alto 57 metri (58,36 metri considerando il piano di fondazione)[1] costruito nell'arco di due secoli, tra il dodicesimo e il quattordicesimo secolo. Con una massa di 14.453 tonnellate,[1][2] vi predomina la linea curva, con giri di arcate cieche e sei piani di loggette. La pendenza è dovuta a un cedimento del terreno sottostante verificatosi già nelle prime fasi della costruzione. L'inclinazione dell'edificio misura 3,9° rispetto all'asse verticale.[3] La torre è gestita dall'Opera della Primaziale Pisana,[4] ente che gestisce tutti i monumenti della piazza del Duomo di Pisa. È stata proposta come una delle sette meraviglie del mondo moderno. ",

                "content": "I lavori iniziarono il 9 agosto 1173. Come era solito fare con i fari e con le costruzioni adiacenti al mare in genere, le fondamenta vennero lasciate a riposare per un anno intero. Alcuni studi attribuiscono la paternità del progetto all'architetto pisano Diotisalvi, che nello stesso periodo stava costruendo il battistero. Le analogie tra i due edifici sono infatti molte, a partire dal tipo di fondazioni. Altri suggeriscono invece Gherardi, mentre secondo il Vasari i lavori furono iniziati da Bonanno Pisano. La tesi del Vasari, ritenuta priva di fondamento, fu invece ritenuta valida soprattutto dopo il ritrovamento nelle vicinanze del campanile di una pietra tombale col nome del Bonanno, murata nell'atrio dell'edificio; inoltre nell'Ottocento fu rinvenuto sempre nei dintorni un frammento epigrafico di materiale rosa, probabilmente un calco su cui venne fusa una lastra metallica, che trova collocazione sullo stipite della porta di ingresso dell'edificio. Su tale frammento si legge, rovesciato: \"cittadino pisano di nome Bonanno\". Tale calco con tutta probabilità era relativo alla porta regia del Duomo, distrutta durante l'incendio del 1595. La prima fase dei lavori fu interrotta a metà del terzo piano, a causa del cedimento del terreno su cui sorge la base del campanile. La cedevolezza del terreno, costituito da argilla molle normalconsolidata, è la causa della pendenza della torre e, sebbene in misura minore, di tutti gli edifici nella piazza. I lavori ripresero nel 1275 sotto la guida di Giovanni di Simone e Giovanni Pisano, aggiungendo alla costruzione precedente altri tre piani. Nel tentativo di raddrizzare la torre, i tre piani aggiunti tendono a incurvarsi in senso opposto alla pendenza. Il campanile fu completato alla metà del secolo successivo, aggiungendo la cella campanaria. ",

                "content": "Dalla sua costruzione lo strapiombo è sostanzialmente aumentato, ma nel corso dei secoli ci sono stati anche lunghi periodi di stabilità o addirittura di riduzione della pendenza. Nel corso dell'Ottocento il campanile fu interessato da importanti restauri, che portarono, ad esempio, all'isolamento del basamento della torre. I lavori, effettuati sotto la direzione di Alessandro Gherardesca, contribuirono a sfatare definitivamente la teoria, sostenuta da alcuni studiosi dell'epoca, secondo la quale il campanile sarebbe stato pensato pendente sin dalla sua origine.[5] Difatti, i saggi del terreno effettuati durante i restauri portarono alla luce la presenza di una notevole quantità di acqua sotterranea che rendeva cedevole il terreno. Per far fronte a questo problema, ne vennero aspirate grandi quantità dal sottosuolo con l'ausilio di pompe, ma ciò favorì il fenomeno della subsidenza e il conseguente aumento della pendenza della torre.[6] Negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo l'inclinazione aveva subito un deciso incremento, tanto che il pericolo del crollo si era fatto concreto. Nel 1993 lo spostamento dalla sommità dell'asse alla base era stato valutato in circa 4,47 metri,[7] ovvero circa 4,5 gradi.[8] Durante i lavori di consolidamento, iniziati nel 1990 e terminati alla fine del 2001, la pendenza del campanile è stata ridotta tramite cerchiatura di alcuni piani, applicazione temporanea di tiranti di acciaio e contrappesi di piombo (fino a 900 tonnellate) e sottoescavazione, riportandola a quella che, presumibilmente, doveva avere 200 anni prima. Inoltre, si è consolidata la base in modo che consentirà, secondo gli esperti, di mantenere in sicurezza la torre per almeno altri tre secoli, permettendo così l'accesso ai visitatori. A partire dal 2004, è iniziato il restauro di tutte le superfici lapidee esterne e il restauro e l’allestimento degli ambienti interni. Alcuni di questi interventi sono stati realizzati grazie ai fondi del Gioco del Lotto, in base a quanto regolato dalla legge 662/96[9]. Dal marzo 2008 la torre ha raggiunto il livello definitivo di consolidamento sotto il profilo dell'inclinazione, attestatosi di nuovo su 3,97°,[3], con uno spostamento alla cima del campanile di quasi mezzo metro, un valore che dovrebbe rimanere inalterato per almeno altri 300 anni. Il successo dell'operazione è legato al nome di Michele Jamiolkowski, docente del Politecnico di Torino e presidente del Comitato internazionale per la Salvaguardia della Torre di Pisa dal 1990 al 2003, a quello di Carlo Viggiani, docente del Dipartimento di ingegneria geotecnica dell'Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II e presidente del Comitato internazionale per la conservazione dei monumenti e dei siti storici e a quello dell'ingegnere John Boscawen Burland, professore del Dipartimento di ingegneria civile dell'Imperial College di Londra. Dopo vent'anni, il 22 aprile 2011 sono terminati i lavori di restauro delle superfici lapidee, sia negli esterni che negli interni.[10] ",

The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. The final work is also called a painting. Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, gesture (as in gestural painting), composition, narration (as in narrative art), or abstraction (as in abstract art).[2] Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a still life or landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive (as in Expressionism), or political in nature (as in Artivism). A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of Buddha or other images of Eastern religious origin. In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action. The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, as well as objects.

Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including Goethe,[3] Kandinsky,[4] and Newton,[5] have written their own color theory. Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word \"red\", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light. There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as F or C♯. For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.). Painters deal practically with pigments,[6] so \"blue\" for a painter can be any of the blues: phthalocyanine blue, Prussian blue, indigo, Cobalt blue, ultramarine, and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear—sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to \"light\" in painting, \"shades\" to dynamics, and \"coloration\" is to painting as the specific timbre of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it. ",

I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature. (Jean Metzinger, circa 1907)[7] Rhythm, for artists such as Piet Mondrian,[8][9] is important in painting as it is in music. If one defines rhythm as \"a pause incorporated into a sequence\", then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations—form, melody, coloration. The distribution of form, or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art, and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetic value is functionality dependent, i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty. Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of \"techne\", directly contributes to the aesthetic value.[8] Music was important to the birth of abstract art, since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul. Wassily Kandinsky often used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings \"improvisations\" and described more elaborate works as \"compositions\". Kandinsky theorized that \"music is the ultimate teacher,\"[10] and subsequently embarked upon the first seven of his ten Compositions. Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the color of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.[11][12] Kandinsky's stage design for a performance of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition illustrates his \"synaesthetic\" concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.[13] Music defines much of modernist abstract painting. Jackson Pollock underscores that interest with his 1950 painting Autumn Rhythm (Number 30).[14] ",

                "content": "The oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, which some historians believe are about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment, and they show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures. However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in Arnhem Land, in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the Kimberley region of North-Western Australia, that is dated 40,000 years old.[15] There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia, Mexico,[16] etc. In Western cultures, oil painting and watercolor painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East, ink and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions. The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first photograph was produced in 1829, photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Dadaism—challenged the Renaissance view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of stylization and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.[citation needed] Modern and Contemporary Art has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of concept, leading some to say, in the 1960s, that painting as a serious art form is dead.[clarification needed] This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defies the previous \"declarations\" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea of pluralism, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments—their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge. Aesthetics ",

Classical philosophers like Plato and Aristotle also theorized about art and painting in particular. Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the truth—it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a craft, similar to shoemaking or iron casting.[17] By the time of Leonardo, painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was in Ancient Greece. Leonardo da Vinci, on the contrary, said that \"Italian: La Pittura è cosa mentale\" (\"English: painting is a thing of the mind\").[18] Kant distinguished between Beauty and the Sublime, in terms that clearly gave priority to the former.[citation needed] Although he did not refer to painting in particular, this concept was taken up by painters such as J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich. Hegel recognized the failure of attaining a universal concept of beauty and, in his aesthetic essay, wrote that painting is one of the three \"romantic\" arts, along with Poetry and Music, for its symbolic, highly intellectual purpose.[19][20] Painters who have written theoretical works on painting include Kandinsky and Paul Klee.[21][22] In his essay, Kandinsky maintains that painting has a spiritual value, and he attaches primary colors to essential feelings or concepts, something that Goethe and other writers had already tried to do. Iconography is the study of the content of paintings, rather than their style. Erwin Panofsky and other art historians first seek to understand the things depicted, before looking at their meaning for the viewer at the time, and finally analyzing their wider cultural, religious, and social meaning.[23] In 1890, the Parisian painter Maurice Denis famously asserted: \"Remember that a painting—before being a warhorse, a naked woman or some story or other—is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\"[24] Thus, many 20th-century developments in painting, such as Cubism, were reflections on the means of painting rather than on the external world—nature—which had previously been its core subject. Recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer Julian Bell. In his book What is Painting?, Bell discusses the development, through history, of the notion that paintings can express feelings and ideas.[25] In Mirror of The World, Bell writes: A work of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed: a history of art urges it onwards, bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination.[26] ",

The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings.

As a technique, it refers to a computer graphics software program that uses a virtual canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a digital artwork a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way. Furthermore, digital painting is not 'computer-generated' art as the computer does not automatically create images on the screen using some mathematical calculations. On the other hand, the artist uses his own painting technique to create the particular piece of work on the computer.[33] ",

The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners, and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored Paris Salon, the Impressionists organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the Salon des Refusés, created by Emperor Napoleon III to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon. Abstract ",

Surrealism developed out of the Dada activities of World War I and the most important center of the movement was Paris.

Northern still lifes had many subgenres: the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas.

This genre of landscape originated in Flanders, where artists such as Paul Bril painted vedute as early as the 16th century. As the itinerary of the Grand Tour became somewhat standardized, vedute of familiar scenes like the Roman Forum or the Grand Canal recalled early ventures to the Continent for aristocratic Englishmen. In the later 19th century, more personal impressions of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted panoramas. ",

                "content": "includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophy of the art produced during that era.[1] The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.[2] Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art. Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubists Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy, Jean Metzinger and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Matisse's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.[3] It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism. Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and other late-19th-century innovators, Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions. Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Picasso and Georges Braque, exemplified by Violin and Candlestick, Paris, from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by Synthetic cubism, practiced by Braque, Picasso, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s. Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter.[citation needed] The notion of modern art is closely related to modernism.[4] ",

                "content": "Although modern sculpture and architecture are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century, the beginnings of modern painting can be located earlier.[5] The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863,[6] the year that Édouard Manet showed his painting Le déjeuner sur l'herbe in the Salon des Refusés in Paris. Earlier dates have also been proposed, among them 1855 (the year Gustave Courbet exhibited The Artist's Studio) and 1784 (the year Jacques-Louis David completed his painting The Oath of the Horatii).[6] In the words of art historian H. Harvard Arnason: \"Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art, but none categorically marks a completely new beginning .... A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years.\"[6] The strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the Enlightenment.[7] The important modern art critic Clement Greenberg, for instance, called Immanuel Kant \"the first real Modernist\" but also drew a distinction: \"The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... . Modernism criticizes from the inside.\"[8] The French Revolution of 1789 uprooted assumptions and institutions that had for centuries been accepted with little question and accustomed the public to vigorous political and social debate. This gave rise to what art historian Ernst Gombrich called a \"self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper.\"[9] The pioneers of modern art were Romantics, Realists and Impressionists.[10] By the late 19th century, additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge: post-Impressionism as well as Symbolism. Influences upon these movements were varied: from exposure to Eastern decorative arts, particularly Japanese printmaking, to the coloristic innovations of Turner and Delacroix, to a search for more realism in the depiction of common life, as found in the work of painters such as Jean-François Millet. The advocates of realism stood against the idealism of the tradition-bound academic art that enjoyed public and official favor.[11] The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work. There were official, government-sponsored painters' unions, while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts. The Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect, and therefore painters should paint in natural light (en plein air) rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work.[12] Impressionist artists formed a group, Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs (\"Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") which, despite internal tensions, mounted a series of independent exhibitions.[13] The style was adopted by artists in different nations, in preference to a \"national\" style. These factors established the view that it was a \"movement\". These traits—establishment of a working method integral to the art, establishment of a movement or visible active core of support, and international adoption—would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art.

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of cubism, several movements emerged in Paris. Giorgio de Chirico moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as Alberto Savinio). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: Enigma of the Oracle, Enigma of an Afternoon and Self-Portrait. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d’Automne, and his work was noticed by Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of Surrealism. Song of Love (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was \"founded\" by André Breton in 1924. World War I brought an end to this phase but indicated the beginning of a number of anti-art movements, such as Dada, including the work of Marcel Duchamp, and of Surrealism. Artist groups like de Stijl and Bauhaus developed new ideas about the interrelation of the arts, architecture, design, and art education. Modern art was introduced to the United States with the Armory Show in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I. ",

In the late 1960s and the 1970s, Land art, Performance art, Conceptual art, and other new art forms had attracted the attention of curators and critics, at the expense of more traditional media.[15] Larger installations and performances became widespread. By the end of the 1970s, when cultural critics began speaking of \"the end of painting\" (the title of a provocative essay written in 1981 by Douglas Crimp), new media art had become a category in itself, with a growing number of artists experimenting with technological means such as video art.[16] Painting assumed renewed importance in the 1980s and 1990s, as evidenced by the rise of neo-expressionism and the revival of figurative painting.[17] Towards the end of the 20th century, a number of artists and architects started questioning the idea of \"the modern\" and created typically Postmodern works.[18] ",

As early as 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company BASF, which was patented by Rohm and Haas. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor.[2] Between 1946 and 1949, Leonard Bocour and Sam Golden invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand Magna paint. These were mineral spirit-based paints.[3] Acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s. Following that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called \"Aquatec\".[4] In 1953, Jose L. Gutierrez produced Politec Acrylic Artists' Colors in Mexico, and Henry Levinson of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced Liquitex colors. These two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists' paints.[5] Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as latex house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of binder (sometimes acrylic, vinyl, pva, and others), filler, pigment, and water. Exterior latex house paints may also be a co-polymer blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.[6] Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints were sold commercially by Liquitex beginning in the 1950s, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early '60s. In 1963, Rowney (part of Daler-Rowney since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist's acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name \"Cryla\".[1] ",

While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues, such as the necessity to combine several polymers, as well as surfactants, plasticizers, dispersants, defoamers and stabilisers in the correct amounts and order. Acrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic mediums[8] or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the range of acrylic mediums is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as medium-density fiberboard can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces.[9] In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based mediums. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint—gel and molding paste are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls,[10] or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon. Acrylic paints are the most common paints used in grattage, a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.[11] ",

                "content": "Acrylic artists' paints may be thinned with water and used as washes in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of gum arabic-based watercolor paints. Instead, the paint is applied in layers, sometimes diluting with water or acrylic medium to allow layers underneath to partially show through. Acrylic paints with gloss or matte finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from Golden, Liquitex, Winsor & Newton and Daler-Rowney); Politec acrylics are fully matte.[12] As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen. When dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although isopropyl alcohol can lift some fresh paint films off. Toluene and acetone can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic gesso, et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin. Acrylic paint can be removed from non-porus plastic surfaces, such as miniatures or models using certain cleaning products such as Dettol (containing chloroxylenol 4.8% v/w)[13] An acrylic sizing should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints, to prevent Support Induced Discoloration (SID). Acrylic paint contains surfactants that can pull up discoloration from a raw canvas, especially in transparent glazed or translucent gelled areas. Gesso alone will not stop SID; a sizing must be applied before using a gesso.[14][15] The viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are retarders to slow drying and extend workability time, and flow releases to increase color-blending ability. ",

                "content": "The vehicle and binder of oil paints is linseed oil (or another drying oil), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an emulsion (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be \"oil-based\", whereas acrylic paint is \"water-based\" (or sometimes \"water-borne\"). The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over underpaintings. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of acrylic retarders. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water. Oil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or turpentine to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use. Oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of \"fat over lean\" must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable. Oil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique \"look and feel\" to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics and vice versa, as each medium has different chemical sensitivities. Some historical pigments are alkali sensitive, and therefore cannot be made in an acrylic emulsion; others are just too difficult to formulate.[24] Approximate \"hue\" color formulations, that do not contain the historical pigments, are typically offered as substitutes.[25][26] Due to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15–20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of wet-in-wet technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly. Meanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion – as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.[27] Another difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil and chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible—sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for linoblock printing (acrylic block printing ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), face painting, airbrushing, watercolor-like techniques, and fabric screen printing. Another difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water.[28] ",

                "content": "Paint was one of the earliest inventions of mankind. Some cave paintings drawn with red or yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide, and charcoal may have been made by early Homo sapiens as long as 40,000 years ago.[1] Paint may be even older. In 2003 and 2004, South African archeologists reported finds in Blombos Cave of a 100,000-year-old human-made ochre-based mixture that could have been used like paint.[2][3] Further excavation in the same cave resulted in the 2011 report of a complete toolkit for grinding pigments and making a primitive paint-like substance.[3][4] Ancient colored walls at Dendera, Egypt, which were exposed for years to the elements, still possess their brilliant color, as vivid as when they were painted about 2,000 years ago. The Egyptians mixed their colors with a gummy substance and applied them separately from each other without any blending or mixture. They appear to have used six colors: white, black, blue, red, yellow, and green. They first covered the area entirely with white, then traced the design in black, leaving out the lights of the ground color. They used minium for red, generally of a dark tinge. Pliny mentions some painted ceilings in his day in the town of Ardea, which had been made prior to the foundation of Rome. He expressed great surprise and admiration at their freshness, after the lapse of so many centuries. Paint was made with the yolk of eggs and therefore, the substance would harden and adhere to the surface it was applied to. Pigment was made from plants, sand, and different soils. Most paints used either oil or water as a base (the diluent, solvent or vehicle for the pigment). A still extant example of 17th-century house oil painting is Ham House in Surrey, England, where a primer was used along with several undercoats and an elaborate decorative overcoat; the pigment and oil mixture would have been ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle. The process was done by hand by the painters, which exposed them to lead poisoning, due to the white-lead powder. In 1718, Marshall Smith invented a \"Machine or Engine for the Grinding of Colours\" in England. It is not known precisely how it operated, but it was a device that increased the efficiency of pigment grinding dramatically. Soon, a company called Emerton and Manby was advertising exceptionally low-priced paints that had been ground with labour-saving technology: By the proper onset of the Industrial Revolution, in the mid-18th century, paint was being ground in steam-powered mills, and an alternative to lead-based pigments had been found in a white derivative of zinc oxide. Interior house painting increasingly became the norm as the 19th century progressed, both for decorative reasons and because the paint was effective in preventing the walls rotting from damp. Linseed oil was also increasingly used as an inexpensive binder. In 1866, Sherwin-Williams in the United States opened as a large paint-maker and invented a paint that could be used from the tin without preparation. It was not until the stimulus of World War II created a shortage of linseed oil in the supply market that artificial resins, or alkyds, were invented. Cheap and easy to make, they also held the color well and lasted for a long time.[5][failed verification][citation needed]  ",

                "title": "Binder or film former ",
                "content": "The binder is the film-forming component of paint.[8] It is the only component that is always present among all the various types of formulations. Many binders are too thick to be applied and must be thinned. The type of thinner, if present, varies with the binder. The binder imparts properties such as gloss, durability, flexibility, and toughness.[9] Binders include synthetic or natural resins such as alkyds, acrylics, vinyl-acrylics, vinyl acetate/ethylene (VAE), polyurethanes, polyesters, melamine resins, epoxy, silanes or siloxanes or oils. Binders can be categorized according to the mechanisms for film formation. Thermoplastic mechanisms include drying and coalescence. Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind. Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles. Thermoplastic film-forming mechanisms are sometimes described as \"thermoplastic cure\" but that is a misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film. Thermosetting mechanisms, on the other hand, are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reaction(s) among the polymers that make up the binder.[10] Thermoplastic mechanisms: Some films are formed by simple cooling of the binder. For example, encaustic or wax paints are liquid when warm, and harden upon cooling. In many cases, they resoften or liquify if reheated. Paints that dry by solvent evaporation and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent are known as lacquers. A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic nitrocellulose lacquers fall into this category, as do non-grain raising stains composed of dyes dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but lacquers generally tend to have better UV resistance and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence. The paint type known as Emulsion in the UK and Latex in the United States is a water-borne dispersion of sub-micrometer polymer particles. These terms in their respective countries cover all paints that use synthetic polymers such as acrylic, vinyl acrylic (PVA), styrene acrylic, etc. as binders.[11] The term \"latex\" in the context of paint in the United States simply means an aqueous dispersion; latex rubber from the rubber tree is not an ingredient. These dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization. Such paints cure by a process called coalescence where first the water, and then the trace, or coalescing, solvent, evaporate and draw together and soften the binder particles and fuse them together into irreversibly bound networked structures, so that the paint cannot redissolve in the solvent/water that originally carried it. The residual surfactants in paint, as well as hydrolytic effects with some polymers cause the paint to remain susceptible to softening and, over time, degradation by water. The general term of latex paint is usually used in the United States, while the term emulsion paint is used for the same products in the UK and the term latex paint is not used at all. Thermosetting mechanisms: Paints that cure by polymerization are generally one- or two-package coatings that polymerize by way of a chemical reaction, and cure into a crosslinked film. Depending on composition they may need to dry first, by evaporation of solvent. Classic two-package epoxies or polyurethanes would fall into this category.[12] The \"drying oils\", counter-intuitively, actually cure by a crosslinking reaction even if they are not put through an oven cycle and seem to simply dry in air. The film formation mechanism of the simplest examples involve first evaporation of solvents followed by reaction with oxygen from the environment over a period of days, weeks and even months to create a crosslinked network.[6] Classic alkyd enamels would fall into this category. Oxidative cure coatings are catalyzed by metal complex driers such as cobalt naphthenate. Recent environmental requirements restrict the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and alternative means of curing have been developed, generally for industrial purposes. UV curing paints, for example, enable formulation with very low amounts of solvent, or even none at all. This can be achieved because of the monomers and oligomers used in the coating have relatively very low molecular weight, and are therefore low enough in viscosity to enable good fluid flow without the need for additional thinner. If solvent is present in significant amounts, generally it is mostly evaporated first and then crosslinking is initiated by ultraviolet light. Similarly, powder coatings contain little or no solvent. Flow and cure are produced by heating of the substrate after electrostatic application of the dry powder.[13] Combination mechanisms: So-called \"catalyzed\" lacquers\" or \"crosslinking latex\" coatings are designed to form films by a combination of methods: classic drying plus a curing reaction that benefits from the catalyst. There are paints called plastisols/organosols, which are made by blending PVC granules with a plasticiser. These are stoved and the mix coalesces. ",

It also controls flow and application properties, and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a thinner oil is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily—once the solvent has evaporated, the remaining paint is fixed to the surface. This component is optional: some paints have no diluent. Water is the main diluent for water-borne paints, even the co-solvent types. Solvent-borne, also called oil-based, paints can have various combinations of organic solvents as the diluent, including aliphatics, aromatics, alcohols, ketones and white spirit. Specific examples are organic solvents such as petroleum distillate, esters, glycol ethers, and the like. Sometimes volatile low-molecular weight synthetic resins also serve as diluents. ",

                "content": "Pigments are granular solids incorporated in the paint to contribute color. Dyes are colorants that dissolve in the paint. Fillers are granular solids incorporated to impart toughness, texture, give the paint special properties,[14] or to reduce the cost of the paint. During production, the size of such particles can be measured with a Hegman gauge. Rather than using only solid particles, some paints contain dyes instead of or in combination with pigments. Pigments can be classified as either natural or synthetic. Natural pigments include various clays, calcium carbonate, mica, silicas, and talcs. Synthetics would include engineered molecules, calcined clays, blanc fixe, precipitated calcium carbonate, and synthetic pyrogenic silicas. Hiding pigments, in making paint opaque, also protect the substrate from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light. Hiding pigments include titanium dioxide, phthalo blue, red iron oxide, and many others. Fillers are a special type of pigment that serve to thicken the film, support its structure and increase the volume of the paint. Fillers are usually cheap and inert materials, such as diatomaceous earth, talc, lime, barytes, clay, etc. Floor paints that must resist abrasion may contain fine quartz sand as a filler. Not all paints include fillers. On the other hand, some paints contain large proportions of pigment/filler and binder. Some pigments are toxic, such as the lead pigments that are used in lead paint. Paint manufacturers began replacing white lead pigments with titanium white (titanium dioxide), before lead was banned in paint for residential use in 1978 by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. The titanium dioxide used in most paints today is often coated with silica/alumina/zirconium for various reasons, such as better exterior durability, or better hiding performance (opacity) promoted by more optimal spacing within the paint film.[15] Micaceous iron oxide (MIO) is another alternative to lead for protection of steel, giving more protection against water and light damage than most paints. When MIO pigments are ground into fine particles, most cleave into shiny layers, which reflect light, thus minimising UV degradation and protecting the resin binder. Most pigments used in paint tend to be spherical, but lamellar pigments, such as glass flake and MIO have overlapping plates, which impede the path of water molecules.[16] For optimum performance MIO should have a high content of thin flake-like particles resembling mica. ISO 10601 sets two levels of MIO content.[17] MIO is often derived from a form of hematite. ",

Thermochromic paints and coatings contain materials that change conformation when heat is applied or removed, and so they change color. Liquid crystals have been used in such paints, such as in the thermometer strips and tapes used in aquaria and novelty/promotional thermal cups and straws. Photochromic materials are used to make eyeglasses and other products. Similar to thermochromic molecules, photochromic molecules change conformation when light energy is applied or removed, and so they change color. Color-changing paints can also be made by adding halochrome compounds or other organic pigments. One patent[19] cites use of these indicators for wall coating applications for light colored paints. When the paint is wet it is pink in color but upon drying it regains its original white color. As cited in patent, this property of the paint enabled two or more coats to be applied on a wall properly and evenly. The previous coats having dried would be white whereas the new wet coat would be distinctly pink. Ashland Inc. introduced foundry refractory coatings with similar principle in 2005[20][21] for use in foundries. Electrochromic paints change color in response to an applied electric current. Car manufacturer Nissan has been reportedly working on an electrochromic paint, based on particles of paramagnetic iron oxide. When subjected to an electromagnetic field the paramagnetic particles change spacing, modifying their color and reflective properties. The electromagnetic field would be formed using the conductive metal of the car body.[22] Electrochromic paints can be applied to plastic substrates as well, using a different coating chemistry. The technology involves using special dyes that change conformation when an electric current is applied across the film itself. This new technology has been used to achieve glare protection at the touch of a button in passenger airplane windows. Color can also change depending on viewing angle, using iridescence, for example, in ChromaFlair. ",

Egg tempera (where the medium is an emulsion of raw egg yolk mixed with oil) is still in use as well, as are encaustic wax-based paints.

This melts the powder and causes it to adhere to the surface. The reasons for doing this involve the chemistries of the paint, the surface itself, and perhaps even the chemistry of the substrate (the object being painted). This is called \"powder coating\" an object. As a gas or as a gaseous suspension, the paint is suspended in solid or liquid form in a gas that is sprayed on an object. The paint sticks to the object. This is called \"spray painting\" an object. The reasons for doing this include: In the liquid application, paint can be applied by direct application using brushes, paint rollers, blades, scrapers, other instruments, or body parts such as fingers and thumbs. Rollers generally have a handle that allows for different lengths of poles to be attached, allowing painting at different heights. Generally, roller application requires two coats for even color. A roller with a thicker nap is used to apply paint on uneven surfaces. Edges are often finished with an angled brush. [23] After liquid paint is applied, there is an interval during which it can be blended with additional painted regions (at the \"wet edge\") called \"open time\". The open time of an oil or alkyd-based emulsion paint can be extended by adding white spirit, similar glycols such as Dowanol (propylene glycol ether) or open time prolongers. This can also facilitate the mixing of different wet paint layers for aesthetic effect. Latex and acrylic emulsions require the use of drying retardants suitable for water-based coatings. Paint application by spray is the most popular method in industry. In this, paint is aerosolized by the force of compressed air or by the action of high pressure compression of the paint itself, and the paint is turned into small droplets that travel to the article to be painted. Alternate methods are airless spray, hot spray, hot airless spray, and any of these with an electrostatic spray included. There are numerous electrostatic methods available. Dipping used to be the norm for objects such as filing cabinets, but this has been replaced by high speed air turbine driven bells with electrostatic spray. Car bodies are primed using cathodic elephoretic primer, which is applied by charging the body depositing a layer of primer. The unchanged residue is rinsed off and the primer stoved. Many paints tend to separate when stored, the heavier components settling to the bottom, and require mixing before use. Some paint outlets have machines for mixing the paint by shaking the can vigorously for a few minutes. The opacity and the film thickness of paint may be measured using a drawdown card. Water-based paints tend to be the easiest to clean up after use; the brushes and rollers can be cleaned with soap and water. Proper disposal of left over paint is a challenge. Sometimes it can be recycled: Old paint may be usable for a primer coat or an intermediate coat, and paints of similar chemistry can be mixed to make a larger amount of a uniform color. To dispose of paint it can be dried and disposed of in the domestic waste stream, provided that it contains no prohibited substances (see container). Disposal of liquid paint usually requires special handling and should be treated as hazardous waste, and disposed of according to local regulations.[24][25] ",

Exposure to VOCs has been related to organic solvent syndrome, although this relation has been somewhat controversial.[32] The controversial solvent 2-butoxyethanol is also used in paint production.[33] In the US, environmental regulations, consumer demand, and advances in technology led to the development of low-VOC and zero-VOC paints and finishes. These new paints are widely available and meet or exceed the old high-VOC products in performance and cost-effectiveness while having significantly less impact on human and environmental health.[citation needed] A polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) was reported (published in 2009) in air samples collected in Chicago, Philadelphia, the Arctic, and several sites around the Great Lakes. PCB is a global pollutant and was measured in the wastewater effluent from paint production. The widespread distribution of PCB suggests volatilization of this compound from surfaces, roofs etc. PCB is present in consumer goods including newspapers, magazines, and cardboard boxes, which usually contain color pigments. Therefore, exist hypothesis that PCB congeners are present as byproduct in some current commercial pigments.[34] ",

                "content": "Painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface. These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract visual relationships. An artist’s decision to use a particular medium, such as tempera, fresco, oil, acrylic, watercolour or other water-based paints, ink, gouache, encaustic, or casein, as well as the choice of a particular form, such as mural, easel, panel, miniature, manuscript illumination, scroll, screen or fan, panorama, or any of a variety of modern forms, is based on the sensuous qualities and the expressive possibilities and limitations of those options. The choices of the medium and the form, as well as the artist’s own technique, combine to realize a unique visual image. Earlier cultural traditions—of tribes, religions, guilds, royal courts, and states—largely controlled the craft, form, imagery, and subject matter of painting and determined its function, whether ritualistic, devotional, decorative, entertaining, or educational. Painters were employed more as skilled artisans than as creative artists. Later the notion of the “fine artist” developed in Asia and Renaissance Europe. Prominent painters were afforded the social status of scholars and courtiers; they signed their work, decided its design and often its subject and imagery, and established a more personal—if not always amicable—relationship with their patrons. During the 19th century painters in Western societies began to lose their social position and secure patronage. Some artists countered the decline in patronage support by holding their own exhibitions and charging an entrance fee. Others earned an income through touring exhibitions of their work. The need to appeal to a marketplace had replaced the similar (if less impersonal) demands of patronage, and its effect on the art itself was probably similar as well. Generally, artists can now reach an audience only through commercial galleries and public museums, although their work may be occasionally reproduced in art periodicals. They may also be assisted by financial awards or commissions from industry and the state. They have, however, gained the freedom to invent their own visual language and to experiment with new forms and unconventional materials and techniques. For example, some painters have combined other media, such as sculpture, with painting to produce three-dimensional abstract designs. Other artists have attached real objects to the canvas in collage fashion or used electricity to operate coloured kinetic panels and boxes. Conceptual artists frequently express their ideas in the form of a proposal for an unrealizable project, while performance artists are an integral part of their own compositions. The restless endeavour to extend the boundaries of expression in Western art produces continuous international stylistic changes. The often bewildering succession of new movements in painting is further stimulated by the swift interchange of ideas by means of international art journals, traveling exhibitions, and art centres. This article is concerned with the elements and principles of design in painting and with the various mediums, forms, imagery, subject matter, and symbolism employed or adopted or created by the painter. For the history of painting in ancient Egypt, see Egyptian art and architecture. The development of painting in different regions is treated in a number of articles: Western painting; African art; Central Asian arts; Chinese painting; Islamic arts; Japanese art; Korean art; Native American art; Oceanic art and architecture; South Asian arts; Southeast Asian arts.

Yet it is the formal interplay of colours and shapes that alone is capable of communicating a particular mood, producing optical sensations of space, volume, movement, and light and creating forces of both harmony and tension, even when a painting’s narrative symbolism is obscure.

Il colore di ogni area è prevalentemente omogeneo e monocromo.[1][2] È spesso associato all'Astrattismo geometrico, alla Op Art e al Color field painting. Il termine venne coniato dal critico d'arte del Los Angeles Times, Jules Langsner, nel 1959, per descrivere le opere di alcuni pittori americani quali John McLaughlin, Lorser Feitelson, Karl Benjamin e Frederick Hammersley che, per distinguersi dalla dilagante ondata dell'Espressionismo astratto e dell'Action painting, dipingevano aree piatte di colore steso in maniera ragionata e con grande precisione.[1][2][3] Lo stile geometrico dell'Hard edge painting richiama le opere di Kasimir Malevich, Wassily Kandinsky, Theo van Doesburg, Josef Albers e Piet Mondrian e si distacca nettamente dal figurativismo della Pop Art in voga allora.[2] Questo nuovo stile si espanse negli Stati Uniti negli anni sessanta, e aveva come base di origine la California.[1] La prima mostra che radunava gli esponenti del nuovo stile pittorico, fu organizzata da Langsner al Los Angeles County Museum of Art, nel 1959, col titolo Four Abstract Classicists - California Hard-edge.[3] Una seconda importante mostra, California Hard-edge painting, anch'essa organizzata da Langsner, venne tenuta al Pavilion Gallery (Newport Pavilion) di Balboa, in California, nel 1964.

                "content": "L'idea originale di un museo di arte moderna fu sviluppata nel 1928 principalmente da Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (moglie di John D. Rockefeller Jr.) e da due delle sue amiche, Lillie P. Bliss e Mary Quinn Sullivan. Il loro gruppo divenne noto con vari soprannomi, tra cui \"the Ladies\" (It. Le Signore), \"the daring ladies\" (It. Le ardite Signore), e \"the adamantine ladies\" (It. Le Signore adamantine). Come sede del museo da loro ideato affittarono un edificio piuttosto modesto e lo aprirono al pubblico il 7 novembre 1929, 9 giorni dopo il crollo di Wall Street. Abby invitò A. Conger Goodyear, in precedenza presidente del consiglio di amministrazione della Albright Art Gallery di Buffalo, a diventare presidente del nuovo museo. La Rockefeller stessa assunse l'incarico di tesoriere. Si trattò di uno dei primi musei statunitensi ad essere dedicato interamente all'arte moderna e d'avanguardia (si veda anche la Gallery of Living Art di Gallatin e La Société Anonyme di K.Dreier) europee.[3] Goodyear convinse Paul J. Sachs e Frank Crowninshield ad unirsi a lui come membri del consiglio di amministrazione. Sachs, condirettore e curatore della sezione stampe e disegni del Fogg Art Museum presso l'Università Harvard, fu incaricato di reperire i curatori. Goodyear gli chiese di suggerire un direttore e lui propose Alfred H. Barr Jr., un suo promettente giovane pupillo. Sotto la guida di Barr la collezione del museo, che in origine era composta di sole otto stampe e un disegno avuti grazie ad una donazione, si ampliò velocemente. Nel novembre del 1929 si tenne la prima mostra di successo, in cui furono esposte opere di Van Gogh, Gauguin, Cézanne, e Seurat.[4] Il museo, dapprima ospitato in sei stanze tra gallerie e uffici al dodicesimo piano del Manhattan's Heckscher Building,[5] all'angolo tra la 5th Avenue e la 57ª Strada, nei suoi primi dieci anni di vita si spostò in altre tre sedi provvisorie. Il ricchissimo marito di Abby era un fiero oppositore del museo (e in verità di tutta l'arte moderna) e si rifiutava di concedere finanziamenti per l'avventura, finanziamenti che dovettero essere trovati in altro modo e la mancanza dei quali si tradusse in effetti nei frequenti cambiamenti di sede. Nondimeno, alla fine egli donò il terreno su cui venne edificata l'attuale sede e fece altre donazioni di tanto in tanto, diventando comunque, suo malgrado, uno dei più grandi benefattori del museo.[6] In quel periodo si tennero molte altre esposizioni di celebri artisti, come la personale di Vincent van Gogh inaugurata il 4 novembre 1935. Comprendeva 66 dipinti ad olio e 50 disegni fino ad allora inediti provenienti dai Paesi Bassi e dei commoventi estratti delle lettere scritte dall'artista; la mostra fu un grande successo di pubblico e diventò \"un'anticipazione dell'attuale importanza di Van Gogh nell'immaginario contemporaneo.\".[7] Nel 1937 il MoMa trasferì i propri uffici e le proprie gallerie nel Time & Life Building all'interno del Rockefeller Center. Si tratta della sede attuale, rinnovata e riprogettata secondo l'International Style dagli architetti modernisti Philip L. Goodwin e Edward Durell Stone. Fu aperta al pubblico il 10 maggio 1939 e all'inaugurazione parteciparono seimila invitati, mentre l'apertura ufficiale venne data via radio dalla Casa Bianca dall'allora Presidente Franklin Delano Roosevelt.[8] Il museo aumentò la propria fama a livello internazionale con la celebre retrospettiva dell'opera di Picasso del 1939-40, organizzata in collaborazione con l'Art Institute of Chicago. Grazie alla varietà delle opere esposte rappresentò una significativa reinterpretazione dell'arte del pittore spagnolo, apprezzata dagli studiosi d'arte e dagli storici. La mostra fu interamente organizzata da Barr, che adorava Picasso, era intesa a glorificare il più grande artista dell'epoca, e si pose come modello per tutte le retrospettive da allora in poi allestite dal museo.[9] Quando il figlio di Abby Rockefeller, Nelson, nel 1939 all'età di trent'anni venne scelto dal consiglio di amministrazione come presidente di rappresentanza, si mise in prima linea nel pubblicizzare e promuovere il museo, sostenendo le nuove acquisizioni e il trasferimento nei nuovi e più ampi locali della 53ª strada. Anche suo fratello, David Rockefeller, nel 1948 entrò a far parte del consiglio di amministrazione e sostituì il fratello come presidente quando questi, nel 1958, venne eletto Governatore di New York. David incaricò il noto architetto Philip Johnson di riprogettare il giardino del museo e, in onore di sua madre, lo chiamò Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. Lui e la famiglia Rockefeller sono stati sempre strettamente legati al museo, anche grazie al Rockefeller Brothers Fund (It. Fondo fratelli Rockefeller), che ha finanziato l'istituzione a partire dal 1947. Attualmente nel consiglio di amministrazione sono presenti David Rockefeller, Jr. e Sharon Percy Rockefeller (moglie del senatore Jay Rockefeller). Wish Tree, l'installazione di Yōko Ono nel Sculpture Garden realizzata nel mese di luglio 2010, è diventata in breve tempo molto popolare: sono numerosissimi i contributi (tra cui cartoncini artistici e poesie) che giungono da tutto il mondo.

Il palazzo è stato ridisegnato dall'architetto giapponese Yoshio Taniguchi. Durante i lavori, dal giugno 2002 al settembre 2004, parte della collezione permanente del museo è stata esposta provvisoriamente al pubblico in quella che è stata soprannominata MoMA QNS, un'ex fabbrica di chiodi e ferramenta della Swingline, che si trova a Long Island City nel quartiere del Queens. L'opera di rinnovamento ha quasi raddoppiato gli ambienti a disposizione procurando quasi 58.000 m² di nuovi spazi. Il Peggy and David Rockefeller Building sul lato occidentale ospita le gallerie dell'esposizione principale, mentre il The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building sul lato orientale accoglie sale per conferenze, concerti, laboratori per gli insegnanti d'arte, la biblioteca del museo e gli archivi. Tra i due edifici si trova, anch'esso ampliato, l'Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, dove si trovano due sculture di Richard Serra. Alla riapertura del MoMa ci sono state polemiche a causa dell'aumento del costo del biglietto d'ingresso, che è passato da 12 a 20 dollari, rendendolo il più costoso museo della città; in ogni caso, grazie alla sponsorizzazione della catena di supermercati Target, il venerdì dopo le 16 l'ingresso è libero per tutti. Discussioni ha suscitato anche la realizzazione dell'opera di rinnovamento in sé. Alcuni critici hanno sostenuto che il lavoro di Taniguchi è uno splendido esempio di architettura contemporanea, mentre altri non hanno affatto gradito alcuni tratti del progetto, come la gestione degli spazi.[10][11][12] Il numero dei visitatori del MoMa è salito fino a 2,5 milioni all'anno a fronte dell'1,5 che entravano nelle sue sale prima del rinnovamento. Il direttore del museo, Glenn D. Lowry, prevede che alla fine questo numero si stabilizzi sui 2,1 milioni di visitatori l'anno.[13] ",

Tradizionalmente, i matte painting sono stati eseguiti da artisti, utilizzando vernici o pastelli, su grandi lastre di vetro per poterli integrare all'interno delle riprese in live action[1]. Il primo esempio di matte painting è stato utilizzato nel 1907 da Norman Dawn nel film Missions of California per rappresentare delle Missioni fatiscenti[2]. Esempi notevoli di riprese utilizzanti questa tecnica si possono trovare nei film Il mago di Oz (mentre Dorothy si avvicina alla Città di Smeraldo), Quarto potere (tenuta di Xanadù) e Guerre stellari (nella scena di Obi-Wan nella stazione del raggio traente)[3]. A partire dalla metà degli anni ottanta, i progressi nel campo della computer grafica hanno permesso agli artisti di lavorare direttamente in maniera digitale. La prima ripresa utilizzante il digital matte, è stata creata da Chris Evans per il film del 1985 Piramide di paura, nella scena del cavaliere che salta dalla vetrata. Evans, prima dipinge la vetrata in acrilico, poi scansiona il dipinto nel sistema della Pixar per ulteriori manipolazioni digitali. L'animazione al computer (anche questa tecnica usata per la prima volta in un film) viene miscelata perfettamente con lo sfondo digitale, cosa che con la tecnica originale non si sarebbe potuto ottenere[4].

Il film del 1990 58 minuti per morire - Die Harder è stato il primo film a utilizzare riprese dal vivo con il tradizionale matte paint su vetro il tutto combinato digitalmente. Il risultato lo si può vedere nell'ultima scena che si svolge sulla pista dell'aeroporto[5]. Entro la fine del decennio la tecnica tradizionale era stata quasi interamente sostituita da quella digitale, con alcune eccezioni come nel film Titanic, dove è stata usata da Chris Evans per la nave di soccorso Carpathia[6]. Il dipinto è stato sostituito da immagini digitali create utilizzando riferimenti fotografici, modelli 3D e tavolette grafiche. Gli artisti del matte painting, combinano le loro texture create digitalmente, all'interno di ambienti 3D generati al computer, permettendo così anche i movimenti tridimensionali della camera[7]. Gli algoritmi di illuminazione usati per simulare sorgenti luminose, hanno espanso il campo di utilizzo della tecnica nel 1995, quando l'algoritmo di illuminazione globale radiosity è stato usato per la prima volta nel film di Martin Scorsese Casinò. La società Matte World Digital ha collaborato con la società LightScape per simulare l'effetto di rimbalzo della luce indiretta[8], di milioni di luci al neon della Las Vegas degli anni settanta[9]. Minori tempi di elaborazione continuano a modificare e ampliare la tecnologie e le tecniche del matte painting. ",

Una minima comparazione è spesso tracciata tra l'action painting statunitense e il tachisme francese. Questo stile ha influenzato alcune tendenze successive dell'arte statunitense come ad esempio il Nevada.[2] Il termine venne coniato dallo statunitense Harold Rosenberg nel 1952,[3] nel suo saggio The American Action Painters[4] e segnalava un maggior cambiamento nella prospettiva estetica dei pittori e dei critici della Scuola di New York. Mentre espressionisti astratti come Jackson Pollock e Willem de Kooning sono stati a lungo schietti nella loro visione di una pittura come un'arena all'interno della quale venire a patti con l'atto della creazione, i primi critici favorevoli alla loro causa come Clement Greenberg, si focalizzarono sull'oggettività delle loro opere. Per Greenberg, era la fisicità delle superfici coagulate e incrostate d'olio dei dipinti la chiave per comprenderli come documenti della lotta esistenziale degli artisti. La critica di Rosenberg spostò l'enfasi dall'oggetto alla lotta stessa, essendo il dipinto finito solo la manifestazione fisica, una specie di residuo, del lavoro effettivo dell'arte, che era nell'atto o processo della creazione del dipinto. La ricerca più recente tende ad attribuire al surrealista in esilio Wolfgang Paalen il ruolo dell'artista e teorico che usò per la prima volta il termine \"azione\" in questo senso e alimentò con esso la teoria della lotta soggettiva. Nella sua teoria dello spazio delle possibilità dipendenti dall'osservatore, nel quale l'artista \"agisce\" come in un rituale estatico, Paalen considera le idee della meccanica quantistica, nonché le interpretazioni idiosincratiche della visione totemica e della struttura spaziale della pittura degli indiani nativi della Columbia Britannica. Il suo lungo saggio Totem Art (1943) ebbe notevole influenza su artisti quali Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko e Barnett Newman; Paalen descrive una visione fortemente artistica dell'arte totemica come parte di un rituale di \"azione\" con legami psichici alla memoria generica e al culto degli antenati matrilineari.[5] Nei due decenni successivi, la ridefinizione di Rosenberg dell'arte come un atto piuttosto che come un oggetto, come un processo piuttosto che un prodotto, fu influente, e condusse alla formazione di numerosi movimenti artistici maggiori dagli Happening e Fluxus alla Conceptual e Earth Art.

La precedente arte di Kandinskij e Mondrian aveva cercato di distogliersi dal ritrarre oggetti e invece cercò di pizzicare e stuzzicare le emozioni dello spettatore. L'Action Art si appropriò di questo tentativo e lo sviluppò, usando le idee di Freud sul subconscio come fondamento principale. I dipinti degli Action Artists non volevano ritrarre nessun oggetto qualunque e allo stesso modo non venivano creati per stimolare l'emozione. Al contrario venivano creati per toccare gli osservatori nel profondo del loro subconscio. Questo venne realizzato dall'artista dipingendo “inconsciamente”. ",

Quando creava i suoi dipinti, permetteva a sé stesso di cadere in uno stato di trance nel quale nessun atto conscio doveva manifestarsi; così se aveva l'impulso istintivo di gettare la sigaretta a terra, lo faceva, sia che davanti ai suoi piedi ci fosse un marciapiede, sia una tela. Cosa provavano a ritrarre gli Action Painter era questo: un'azione spontanea completamente eseguita senza pensarci. Quindi si pensa all'atto di cui si può riconoscere le manifestazioni come atto inconscio. Il Reynolds News, in un titolo del 1959, riferendosi a un'opera di Pollock, così scriveva: \"Questa non è arte, è uno scherzo di cattivo gusto.\"[6] La “action painting” non mostra né esprime una realtà oggettiva o soggettiva, ma libera una tensione che in grande quantità si è accumulata nell'artista. È azione non ideata e non progettata nei modi di esecuzione e negli effetti finali. Esprime il malessere dell'artista in una società del benessere dove tutto è progettato; è reazione violenta dell'artista-intellettuale contro l'artista-tecnico. ",
