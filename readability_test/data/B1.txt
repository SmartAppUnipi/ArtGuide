 I am interested in this job because I am currently looking for an opportunity to use the skills I learnt in my college. I have recently completed a 16-week part-time accounting course (AAT Level 2 Certificate).  The course covered book-keeping, recording income and receipts and basic costing. We used a wide range of computer packages, and I picked up the accounting skills easily. I was able to work alone with very little extra help. I passed the course with merit. I believe my success was due to my thorough work, my numeracy skills and my attention to detail. During the course, I had experience of working to deadlines and working under pressure.  Although this was sometimes stressful, I always completed my work on time.

Unfortunately, the course did not include a work placement, so I have not practised my skills in a business setting, and I am now looking for an opportunity to do so.  I am particularly looking for a job in a small company such as yours, as I believe I will be able to interact with a wider range of people, and as a result, learn more skills.  I would like to progress within a company and gain more responsibilities over the years.

Although I do not have work experience in finance, I have experience in working in an office environment.  Before starting the accounting course, I worked for 6 months in a recruitment office as a receptionist. My duties involved meeting and greeting clients and visitors, taking phone calls, audio and copy typing and checking stock. I also had to keep the petty cash and mail records.  Through this work, I developed my verbal and written communication skills. I had to speak confidently to strangers and deliver clear messages.  I enjoyed working in a team environment.  I believe the office appreciated my friendly manner and efficient work.
