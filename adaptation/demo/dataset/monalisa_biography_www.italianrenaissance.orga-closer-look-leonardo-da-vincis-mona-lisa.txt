Leonardo’s Mona Lisa is one of the most famous paintings in the world.  Today it is in the Louvre in Paris, but it was produced in Florence when Leonardo moved there to live from about 1500-1508.  It is sometimes called La Jaconde in French (or in Italian, La Giaconda) because it is believed to be the portrait of the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, whose name was Lisa (Mona = short for “Madonna” (lady)).  This identification was provided by Vasari in the sixteenth century, but this was later disputed.  It is likely that the uncertainty over the sitter’s identification has added to the mystery and lure surrounding this painting over the years.

According to Vasari, the painting was not finished over the course of four years, which may have resulted in the difference in the craquelure (level of cracking on the surface) in the face and in the hands.  The portrait shows what appears to be a typical portrait of a woman in which her wealth is not primary thing on display.  She is veiled, her hands are crossed, and she has a faint smile  – or some expression masquerading as a smile – which seems to capture the viewer’s gaze.
