Just one little miscalculation made in the 11th century left us with an amazing 14,500 ton leaning tower! Known among Italians as Torre Pendente di Pisa, this piece of architecture is significally different from most medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is located on the city’s main square, Piazza del Duomo. This square is also known as Piazza dei Miracoli, “Miracles’ Square”, a name given by Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 1987 the whole square became one of the many Italian UNESCO World Heritage sites! The leaning tower is the third oldest building built in the square, after the wonderful Cathedral and its Baptistry. With its many columns and archs, this tower boasts an advanced knowledge of weight and load characteristics, showing the Italian architectures’ expertise. Why is the tower leaning then? What the architect didn’t account for was the base of the tower, which was built on a dense section of clay… The Early Years of the Leaning Tower of Pisa The construction of the Tower began in 1173. Originally designed to be a bell tower, it stood upright for over 5 years, but when the third floorwas completed in 1178 it began to lean. Italians were shocked by the event, as the tower began to lean ever so slightly. The thing is the foundation of the tower, which is only 3-meter deep, was built on a dense clay mixture. This mix impacted the soil and furthermore the clay was not strong enough to hold the tower upright. As a result the weight of the tower began to diffuse downward until it had found the weakest point. Due to this problem, construction works stopped for 100 years. The government decided to focus on its war with Genoa and hope that the soil would settle in the meantime. Mistake after mistake! After 100 years, engineer Giovanni di Simone stepped forward and started to add more floors to the tower. He tried to compensate for the original lean by making one side of the upper floors taller than the other. This only caused the tower to lean over even more… Unconcerned by the leaning, the tower was added a 7th floor in the second part of the 14th century, as well as a bell tower, and then the tower was left on its own until the 19th century. In 1838 architect Alessandro Della Gherardesca, dug a pathway at the base of the tower to allow people to admire the intricately crafted base. This caused the tower to lean even more, probably due to the digging of its base. Tower survives World War II World War II caused destruction all over the World. The leaning tower of Pisa, however, was very very lucky. In fact when American soldiers invaded Pisa, they were ordered to destroy all buildings as to prevent enemy snipers to find suitable places to hide. There were no exceptions to this rule, and many buildings were blown up everyday, as the US forces advanced over the Italian countryside. However a retreat took place shortly after the arrival of the Americans, making unnecessary to destroy the Leaning Tower of Pisa! And it is still standing! Twenty years after the end of the war Italy asked help to avoid the Leaning Tower from toppling. They didn’t want the tower to lose its leaning though, because it is now the symbol of the city, a landmark loved by tourists from all over the world. As a temporary measure engineers and architects installed a leaden counterweight of 800 tonnes. In 1987 the Leaning Tower of Pisa was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, together with the entire Piazza Del Duomo, but in 1990 it was closed. Its bells were removed and the tower was anchored, only to reopen in 2001.Tourists now can safely visit the leaning tower of Pisa!

Like its name suggest, it actually does lean to one side. The tower started to lean during construction because the foundation was built on soft ground that had difficulty supporting the weight. The lean became worse as construction continued for several decades. Between 1990 and 2001 it was stabilized and the lean was partially fixed. Interesting Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts: In Italian the Leaning Tower of Pisa is Torre pendente di Pisa. It was built as a freestanding bell tower for the cathedral in Pisa. On the side where the tower is lower because of the lean it stands at 187.27 feet. On the high side of the tower it stands at 186 feet. The tower weighs about 14,500 tons. That's a lot of weight for a building to have to support when it has been leaning since it was built. There are approximately 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side of the tower. The Leaning Tower of Pisa took 344 years to build, beginning in August 1173. It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground. The construction was stopped twice, the first time for 100 years, the second time in 1284. Both times it was due to wars. If it hadn't been for the two pauses in construction it would have taken between 185 and 195 years to complete. Inside the tower there are seven bells. Each bell represents one note of the musical major scale. The first stones used to form the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa were purchased with the money left to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie by Donna Berta di Bernardo in 1172. Nobody seems to be able to pinpoint the identity of who the actual original architect really was. During World War II, the Allies heard that Germans were using the Leaning Tower of Pisa as an observation post. Once the Allies saw how beautiful the tower was they refrained from destroying it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Also included in this designation were the cathedral, cemetery and the baptistery. In 1989 another tower called the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed. This sped up the restoration efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower was closed to the public from 1989 until 2001, after the restoration was complete. It is thought that the restoration will keep the Leaning Tower of Pisa stable for at 300 years more. In 2008 engineers stated that the Tower had stopped moving. This is the first time in its history that it has not been slowly leaning further to one side. If the construction of the tower had not been halted the first time due to war it would have toppled over. The hundred years it had to sit helped to let it settle (compact). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a circular shape and has eight floors. The 7 bells are located on the eighth floor. Some people have suggested that the tower should be straightened. The people have Pisa had said they would rather see it fall over than be straightened. After all, how could you call it the Leaning Tower of Pisa if it didn't lean? medianet_width = \"600\"; medianet_height = \"280\"; medianet_crid = \"426465885\"; medianet_versionId = \"3111299\"; Related Links: Facts Wonders of the World Facts Animals Facts (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <a href=\"http://www.softschools.com/facts/wonders_of_the_world/leaning_tower_of_pisa_facts/93/\">Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts</a> var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\"); document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\")); var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-286169-1\"); pageTracker._initData(); pageTracker._trackPageview(); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-2\"); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-3'); }); More Topics Handwriting Spanish Facts Examples Formulas Difference Between Inventions Literature Flashcards 2019 Calendar Online Calculators Multiplication Educational Videos"}],"keywords":["description"]},{"url":"https://www.livitaly.com/leaning-tower-of-pisa-history/","title":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours","sections":[{"title":"main","content":"Italy Travel Blog The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours April 18, 2018 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures in Italy & the world, so it’s little surprise that it draws in over 1 million visitors each year to see and take photos with the amazing monument. It has been depicted in numerous books, movies, and cartoons, so it’s little surprise that there are so many stories and tales about the tower. This stunning structure stands (or leans) in the city of Pisa, which is a short ride from Florence, the capital city of central Italy’s Tuscany region. The tower is the third oldest structure in the city’s Piazza del Duomo, or “Cathedral Square” in English. Most people are familiar with the tower from seeing photographs of their friends and family posing next to them (don’t worry we have all done it) but many don’t know much more about the intriguing history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Leaning Tower of Pisa History As the city of Pisa grew as an important Italian seaport, its people wanted to emphasize its significance with a cathedral complex. This so-called “Field of Miracles” included a baptistery, a cathedral & of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was then built to serve as the bell tower. Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1137, but it was not completed until the mid-14th century due to war, debt, and other interruptions which stalled its construction. Trying to find out the exact history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a little bit more complex than you may think. The design of the tower has historically been attributed to the 12th century Italian artist Bonanno Pisano, who was most well-known for his bronze castings. While his name was found in a shard of cast at the foot of the tower in the early 19th century, some historians argue that this is not evidence of his contribution and that the cast may instead be related to the cathedral that was destroyed in the late 16th century. In more recent times, some researchers have suggested that Diotisalvi might have been the original architect, because he designed the Baptistery and the bell tower of San Nicola in Pisa, and all of these works show some resemblance to each other. Guglielmo has been said to have lain the foundations of the tower, and a builder named Gerardo di Gerardo has also been credited with the early phases of construction. Giovani di Simone was involved in the second phase and Tommaso Pisano in the final phase.

So obviously everyone knows the tower because it leans – but the tower was not purposefully designed to lean. Due to the soft ground that the tower was built on and shifting soil upon which it was built, it served to destabilize the foundation. The tower had begun to lean by the time its builders reached the third story. Over time, it began to fall about two millimeters per year, until it was leaning at an angle of 5.5 degrees. Restoration work has taken place in the late 20th century to make sure that the tower doesn’t fall over, however, the leaning tower of Pisa now leans a little less than 4 degrees. It is now thought that the tower will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries but in fact, it may never fall. In the wake of this careful restoration project and the attraction’s re-opening, there has never been a better time to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa! How Was the Leaning Tower of Pisa Used? In legend, Galileo used the tower to prove that the speed of a falling object is independent of its mass. He supposedly dropped different weights of cannonballs from the top of the tower. The Germans were also suspected to have used the tower for observation during the Second World War. Eventually it became a major tourist attraction, full of people attempting to take the perfect photo. The Leaning Tower was closed to the public from 1990-2001 for stabilization, but it has since been reopened. The tower was on the brink of collapse not long ago. However, because of the restoration project conducted in the 1990s, which called upon the expertise of mathematicians, scientists, architects, and other talents, it is now thought that the Tower of Pisa will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries. In fact, it may never fall. Kathleen Bello I am so grateful to find your particular post.

As a vital seaport and a major center of trade, many people visited the city. In the early days, Pisa was a popular resting place for pilgrims from Europe on their way to Jerusalem. The military fleet of Pisa was most successful. In 871 the fleet helped defend the Salerno from attackers, and it was Pisans that forced the Arab troops from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia in 1015. The city of Pisa, Italy As their riches and influence increased, the city of Pisa, Italy, became more and more powerful. The island of Corsica came under Pisan control in 1077, and in 1113 so did the Balearic Islands near Spain. The Pisans enjoyed a time of great prosperity The decline of Pisa began in 1284 when Genoa defeated the Pisans in battle. The islands controlled by Pisa were lost and the influence began to decline. By the 15th century the Arno River had become so filled with silt that it completely cut off Pisa from the sea. This marked the end of Pisa as a useful port and the end of its wealth and power. Pisa Tower Construction In 1174, engineer Bonnano Pisano laid a marble foundation large enough to park about 16 Ferrari 328s in and started building the campanile for the cathedral and baptistry of Pisa. The Romanesque Tower of Pisa, comprising 14,000 tonnes of white marble, was completed 176 years later – but it was also embarrassingly crooked. Because there was a lot of water under the ground in this area, Bonnano was able to place the foundation only about 10 feet down into the ground. As the first story of the tower was completed, the south side began to sink. The builders tried to make it look better by building the columns and arches on the south side about an inch taller than those on the north side. However by the time they got to the fourth story, they had to make the southern columns 2 inches taller than the northern ones. The tower just continued to lean, and because of the difficulties the construction was stopped. Pisa Tower Architecture In 1234, the architect Benenato discovered that the tower was leaning even more. Now the south side of the fourth story was a full 6 inches shorter than the north side. He added a fifth story, again making the south columns taller than the north ones. After adding that one story, Benenato gave up, and again construction on the tower stopped. Almost thirty years later, in 1260, William of Innsbruck added the sixth and seventh stories to the Tower of Pisa. In 1350 Tommaso Pisano started work on the eighth story of the tower, the bell chamber. He found that the tower was still sinking, and so he made the spiral stairs inside the tower and the wall of the bell chamber higher on the south side than on the north. The tower was finally completed in 1372, almost 200 years after it was begun, and it was still leaning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

2018Original:Dec 3, 2015Why does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean?Author:Sarah PruittPick any day in the Piazza del Duomo in the Italian city of Pisa, and you will undoubtedly spot a bunch of tourists posing for the same photo: hands outstretched towards the cathedral’s conspicuously tilting bell tower, as if they are supporting it with their sheer strength. The so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world, although maybe not for the reasons its original architects would have wanted. In 1173, construction began on a white marble bell tower for the cathedral complex in Pisa, located between the Arno and Serchio rivers in Tuscany, central Italy. By the time builders had finished the third of eight planned stories about five years later, the tower’s foundation had begun to settle unevenly on the ground beneath it, a dense mixture of clay, sand and shells. As a result, the structure had begun to tilt visibly toward the south. Shortly after that, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, another Italian city-state, halting construction for nearly a century. This delay allowed the foundation to settle further, likely prevented the bell tower’s premature collapse. When construction resumed, chief engineer Giovanni di Simone tried to compensate for the lean by adding extra masonry to the short side, but the additional weight caused the structure to tilt even further. The tower was officially completed around 1370, but its lean only increased over the next six centuries, becoming an integral part of the monument’s quirky appeal. Despite various attempts to reinforce it, Pisa’s tower continued to subside at a rate of some 0.05 inches per year, placing it in increasing danger of collapse. By 1990, it was leaning 5.5 degrees (or some 15 feet) from the perpendicular–the most extreme angle yet. That year, the monument was closed to visitors and the bells removed as engineers started extensive reparations to stabilize it. By siphoning earth from beneath and adding counterweights to the tower’s north end, they were able to reduce the lean to 13.5 feet, or 4.0 degrees from perpendicular. The straightening continued after the tower reopened in 2001, and in 2008 sensors showed the subsiding motion had stopped, after a total improvement of some 19 inches. Engineers now believe the Leaning Tower of Pisa will remain stable for some 200 years, barring an earthquake or other unpredictable disaster.Tagsterms:ItalyEngineeringBy Sarah PruittFACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

(Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) In 1990 an international team of engineers, mathematicians, and historians met on the Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Their task was to figure out how to save an 800-year-old historic building that was close to collapsing. The structure was then tilted by 5.5 degrees to one side. If something wasn't done soon, the world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa would come crashing to the ground. The structure was originally meant to simply be a free standing bell tower (or campanile) for the city of Pisa's cathedral. Such towers were commonly built in 10th century Italy to symbolize the town's power and economic wealth. Historians aren't sure who the structure's original architect might be. For many years it was thought to be Bonanno Pisano, a Pisa resident and artisan noted for creating a number of ornate bronze doors for cathedrals. However, scholars now suspect that Diotisalvi, who was the architect of Pisa's San Nicola bell tower and the city's baptistery, might actually be responsible. Seven Quick Facts Height: 183 feet, 3 inches (55.8m) Angle of tilt: 3.97 degrees - 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) off vertical Steps to top: 296 Construction: Started 1173, finished 1372 Function: Bell Tower for the Cathedral at Pisa, Italy Built of: Masonry and Marble Other: Contains 7 bells tuned to the major musical scale In either case we know that construction on the tower started in 1173 AD near the city's cathedral on a piece of land known as Piazza dei Miracoli (\"Square of Miracles\"). The tower was round and 52 feet (16m) in diameter at the base with a projected height of 191 feet (58m). The first level was to be taller than the rest and have an elaborate entry portal decorated with sculptures of monsters and animals. The second story would have open marble arcades with many columns. On top of that there would be five more levels with facades similar to the second story. Finally, the roof would be capped with a bell chamber designed to contain 7 bells. Imperfect from the Beginning By the time the third floor was finished in 1178, it was clear that the tower was leaning slightly to the northwest. The problem was that the foundation was only 10 feet (3m) deep and the soil underneath was soft and unstable. The citizens of Pisa decided to stop construction for a while and let the tower settle a bit with the hope that it would straighten itself out, or at least stop moving. In any case, several wars with neighboring towns required their attention. The tower now leans 3.97 degrees off of true.(Photo by Softeis. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license) It was almost a hundred years before they got back to doing more work on it. In 1272, under the direction of Giovanni di Simone, construction resumed. To try and compensate for the tilt, he designed the upper stories so that they had one side slightly taller than the other. By the time the 7th floor was completed, it became apparent that the building was moving again and the lean increasing, this time to the south. In 1284 work was halted again due to another war. Finally, the bell tower was finished in 1372. Over the next few centuries the 7 bells would be installed in the bell chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale. The tower continued to move and by the 16th century it was a full 3 degrees off vertical. Pisa's campanile, however, wasn't the only European tower that was crooked. Over the years many of these collapsed or were replaced with newer structures. Pisa's tilted bell tower, however, survived and eventually became a major landmark not despite its lean, but because of it. In 1911 engineers began careful measurements of the tower's angle and realized that it was still moving at the rate of a 1/20 of an inch per year. In 1934 engineers working for the dictator Benito Mussolini - who found the tilt an offense to his Fascist ideals - attempted to correct the problem by injecting 200 tons of concrete under the foundation. This, however, just made the problem worse. By 1989 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees and its top was out of plumb by 17 feet (5m). Its predicament was underscored when a similar bell tower in the town of Pavia unexpectedly collapsed. Officials decided to close the Pisa's tower to visitors, evacuate the area under it and put together an international team to figure out how to save it. Fixing the Tower One of the seven bells housed in the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018)) Team member John Burland, a soil mechanics specialist from Imperial College London, wondered if removing soil from under the tower's northern foundation might help correct the tilt. After running a number of computer simulations, the team decided that such a strategy was their best bet. To keep the building from coming apart while they worked on it, a number of temporary measures were put in place. First, steel bands were wrapped around the first floor to support the masonry there. Then, 827 tons of lead weights were placed on the northern side of the building to act as a counter-balance. A concrete ring was also placed around the building at the third level connected to heavy steel cables anchored in the ground to keep the structure from any further southern movement. Finally the massive bells were removed to decrease the total weight of the building. With these measures in place, the team drilled a hole at an angle under the northern side of the tower to remove some earth. Over a number of years they repeated this procedure while measuring what it did to the tilt of the tower. A total of 41 holes were made removing 77 tons of soil causing the tower to move backwards toward a more stable position. By 2001 the tower had moved back to the same lean it had in the 1930's and officials decided it was safe to reopen the structure to visitors. The intention was never to straighten the tower completely. It still leans 3.97 degrees out of true with the top being 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) from vertical. The cables and other temporary measures have been removed. Engineers believe they have stabilized the tilt so that the tower should be safe for at least several hundred years, barring a major incident like an earthquake. Looking up at the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) That's a relief to the citizens of Pisa for whom the well-loved, but off-kilter tower is a world recognized icon for their town and a source of tourist dollars. The structure isn't only known for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. Galileo Galilei, the astronomer, is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball from the tower to prove that weight does not affect how fast an object falls. While his conjecture indeed proved true, historians have called into question whether he actually did his test from the top of the tower at Pisa. Even so, the tower remains strongly associated in people's minds with the great scientist. Why Does it Stand At All? One of the mysteries of the tower is not just why it leans, but why it continues to stand at all. The area around Pisa is subject to earthquakes and the tower has lived through at least four major quakes during its life, yet even as off-kilter as it is, it still stands. In 2018 a study led by Roma Tre University's Professor Camillo Nuti suggests that the reason it leans is the exact same reason it still stands. \"Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Pisa tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\" noted Professor George Mylonakis, from the University of Bristol, UK, who was a member of the team that worked on the study. According to the report the softness of the soil, combined with the stiffness of the tower, prevents it from resonating, or vibrating along, with the earthquake's ground motion and protects the structure from damage. In 1987 the tower, along with the associated cathedral, baptistery and cemetery, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower has also been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. Ironically, while the preservation efforts have saved the tower, they have also caused it to lose the title of the most crooked structure in the world, This distinction now goes to the leaning tower of Suurhusen, in Germany, which is 5.3 degrees out of true.

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

This is certainly true of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a monument striking for its tilt of approximately 4 degrees. Bonanno Pisano, Campanile (Leaning Tower), exterior, 1174-1350, Pisa, Italy. (c) 2006, SCALA, Florence / ART RESOURCE, N.Y., artres.com, scalarchives.com The tilt was even more pronounced before modern efforts at stabilization began, and by some accounts has reached 8-10 degrees in past centuries. But while stabilizing the tower has been important to its physical preservation, it may have negatively affected the church’s historical legacy. Since the Leaning Tower of Pisa was straightened out, several other buildings–mainly in Germany and Switzerland–have been vying for the slanted spotlight, as was humorously reported by the New York Times in 2012. However, no attempt at dethroning Pisa as home to the farthest leaning building has been as bold as that of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. Starting in 2007, the city began work on the Capital Gate, which rises at an 18-degree westward lean–more than four times that of the Leaning Tower of Pisa–along the city’s waterfront. The topography and skyline of Abu Dhabi and of other major cities on the Persian Gulf have been rapidly changing in the past decade, with projects for major museums and cultural centers, shopping malls, offices, and condominiums underway or already completed. In Abu Dhabi alone, two outposts of renowned art museums are in the works – a branch of the Louvre, and a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi designed, respectively, by the famed architects Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. RMJM Architects, Capital Gate; overview of the building from nearby mosque exterior, 2010, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Even amid this development, though, the Capital Gate (opened in 2011) remains a unique structure for its arresting form, and the engineering feats that allowed for it. The architectural firm behind the building, RMJM Architects, devised a complex system to ensure that the Capital Gate stays at its intended lean. The building was the first to use what is known as a ‘pre-cambered’ core. 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel were sculpted in the opposite direction of the building’s incline and placed slightly off-center at its base. As the building rose, this core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position to support the mammoth structure. Other design elements employed to reinforce the Capital Gate’s unique shape include a steel exoskeleton, supported by 490 piles drilled 100 feet underground. The interior of the building matches the exterior in opulence. The Capital Gate houses an exhibition center, 20,000 square meters of luxury office space, and a five-star Hyatt hotel. Guests lucky enough to stay in one of the Hyatt’s rooms are greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows displaying a panoramic view of the city through custom-built window paneling. A large, airy atrium fills the central 17th and 18th floors, and contains both a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge. The 18th floor is also where the ‘Splash’–a 320-meter metal element that sweeps down from the outside of the building and connects to the nearby Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre–is placed. More than a mere aesthetic flourish, the Splash turns into a canopy for the Centre’s outdoor grandstand, used for viewing parades and other national events. Unsurprisingly, the client behind both buildings is one in the same: the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC), a national body that oversees conferences and exhibitions.

Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Exhibitions have a way of inspiring futuristic architecture. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair; the Unisphere in New York City is a relic of the 1964/5 event; and in 2010 the city of Shanghai completed the Expo Axis, featuring one of the world’s largest membrane roofs, to accommodate the 2010 year’s World Exposition. The Capital Gate’s metallic, undulating shape lends it–and in turn the events it hosts–a cutting-edge appearance at a time when this region is staking its claim as a future international center for business and culture. Despite its bid for dominance in the architectural monuments game, though, Pisa may still have Abu Dhabi beat. The Capital Gate was given the honor of the Guinness World Record for “farthest leaning man-made structure,” but unless something goes awry with its foundation (and let’s hope it doesn’t), Pisa still houses, arguably, the world’s quirkiest and most iconic slanted structure – tilted by human error, not meticulous design plans. – Hannah Stamler You may also be interested in: Contemporary Architecture in the United Arab Emirates Posted in Features Related Posts August 26, 2019 Browsing Artstor just got easier!

(Image: © Library of Congress) Experts say the famous tower at Pisa will lean for at least another 200 years. It may even stay upright well, almost upright forever. That's all thanks to a restoration project, which brought the tower back from the brink of collapse a decade ago.From the first moment of its construction on unstable subsurface soils in 1173, Pisa's bell tower tilted farther and farther to the south. Its early-onset lean even influenced the way it was built, as its architects tried to compensate by angling the structure northward, resulting in its being banana-shaped.A few ill-advised construction projects accelerated the Leaning Tower's invisibly slow fall during the past couple of centuries; it tilted 5.5 degrees, its acutest angle ever, in 1990. By all calculations, the tower should have toppled at just 5.44 degrees, but fortunately it defied the predictions of computer models just long enough for engineers to come up with a fix.Restoration work undertaken from 1999 to 2001 stabilized the tower. Engineers placed weights on the structure's north end, while at the same time extracting soil from below, causing it to slowly sink back in that direction.The Leaning Tower of Pisa still leans south, but now it does so at just 3.99 degrees. Barring a large earthquake or other unforeseen catastrophe, engineers believe it will stay put for at least a few hundred years.How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean?Why Are Construction Cranes So Dangerous?Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries, then join us on Facebook. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; var taboola_lists = []; function taboola_is_device(device) { if ((! device) || device === null || (typeof device) === 'undefined') return true if (device === 'amp') return false if (device === 'desktop' && window.screen.width >= 700) return true if (device === 'mobile' && window.screen.width < 700) return true return false } if (taboola_is_device(\"desktop\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-f\", container: \"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"mobile\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-g\", container: \"taboola-mobile-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mobile Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"amp\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-a\", container: \"\", placement: \"below-main-column\", target_type: \"\" }); } for(var i = 0; i < taboola_lists.length; i++){ _taboola.push(taboola_lists[i]); } Sign Up for e-mail newsletters Get breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky particles and more!

How do we know? ...we went there and counted ourselves! Believe it or not, no one is reporting this fact right… neither Wikipedia nor Google and not even the signs in “Piazza dei Miracoli” in Pisa, where the Tower stands... or for better use of words, leans.So we went there and we counted the steps one by one ON VIDEO! We had the feeling something was wrong with the steps count when we noticed that practically every web page on the topic reports a different number.Figures range from 250 to 300 and it is very hard to understand who shall be trusted. There are 5 flights of stairs in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of which is spiraling around the entire building! As far as we can tell, THIS is the only article on the entire Internet reporting the correct number of steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. How can we be so sure? ...tired of mismatching numbers, we went to Pisa and climbed the Tower to count the steps with our own eyes!The figure we got is totally different from anything published online to this date. Yes, we feel your pain... the fact that one cannot really trust information found on the Internet is mind-boggling. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The video of our descent is at the bottom of this article... there you can see how the inside of the Tower looks like and you can even count the steps for yourself! The Stairs in the Leaning Tower First off, there are FIVE different stairs to get to the top of the Tower.Some are just a few steps to access the various parts of the Tower (1st, 2nd, 5th) and two of them are full-size spiral staircases (3rd and 4th) to move between the floors. <ul><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/45c18c7b22454c99e10c91d4bf6e3281.jpeg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/19e09108119c31304b49050bf0dd93ce.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-4.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/0bc58cd05538afd1e09b9f0226093702.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/415b2482fc65c03643b19772ea00ae81.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/b4736076b2b55b2354abcadeedd61a9d.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li></ul> The first stairs bring from the street level to the base of the Tower, about 150cm lower (5 feet).Once there, you have to climb a few steps to enter the Tower through it’s - one and only - entrance door.Let’s call this stairs nr #2. As you enter the monument, it strikes you… this thing is leaning big time! Like the rest of the Tower, the floor of the entrance room is inclined and you can feel it under your feet. The feeling you get is much stronger than what your eyes perceive from the outside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The inside of the Tower is hollow. There is only one room with virtually no ceiling. As a matter of fact, the ceiling is about 49m high, on the top of the 7th floor (image on the left). It feels big… and it feels so leaning… On the left of the entrance door, there is the main staircase that leads to the top. It is a spiral staircase that wraps clockwise around the Tower. This is the 3rd staircase you find in the monument (image below). The staircase is pretty narrow and people going up must stop giving the way to those coming down. The stairs climb at regular steps and they are interrupted at each floor by small intermediate landings. At each landing, there is an opening on the outside. Openings are door-sized and they are closed with metal grates to prevent visitors accessing the columns area and walking along the tiny edge… that’d be VERY dangerous. The main staircase ends right at the bottom of the 7th floor. Once you are up, you can walk around the entire circumference of the Tower and admire the wonderful view. You are now walking outside, in the space between the wall of the Tower and the columns of the 7th floor. This space is about 1 meter wide (3 feet) and, like the openings of the floors below, it is protected by metal grates installed right before the columns. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Getting to the Top To get to the top of the 7th floor you have to climb on more flight of stairs (the 4th in the Tower). This last spiral staircase is really tiny and two persons can hardly exchange the way. These stairs land at the base of the bells chamber (8th floor). To enter the bells chamber you have a fifth set of steps to climb (just a few steps). You are now standing inside the bells chamber, on the bottom of the 8th floor.This is the highest point allowed to visitors. There is another flight of tiny stairs that climb up to the very top of the Tower but it is closed to the public since it leads on the tiny edge of the top of the bells chamber (8th floor). You might be surprised to find out that the floor of the 8th story is perfectly flat… well, no wonders, it took 200 years to figure out how to make that happen and they eventually got it right. When you are on the top of the 7th floor you are standing on the tallest building in Pisa. The view is unobstructed in every direction, except for the West, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of majestic Cathedral which very top is the same height as the Tower. The number of Steps It is time to do the math on the actual steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The first flight of stairs has 8 steps (from street level to the base of the Tower) The second flight has 4 steps (from the base to the inside) On the main staircase there are: 58 steps to reach the 2nd floor 31 steps to reach the 3rd floor 30 steps to reach the 4th floor 30 steps to reach the 5th floor 32 steps to reach the 6th floor 36 steps to reach the 7th floor The fourth flight of stairs to go from the 7th to the 8th floor also counts 36 steps. Finally, there are 4 steps on the short ramp to access the bell chamber (on the 8th floor). Summing up, there are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bells chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. The grand total is 269 steps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, this number is 24 steps shorter of what published in the signs in the Square of Miracles, right below the Tower (293), 25-27 steps less than what stated by Wikipedia and 15 steps less than what answered by Google in its Answer box at the moment of writing. Hopefully, Google and Wikipedia will soon acknowledge this mistake and refer to this post as the correct source of information when it comes to the question “how many steps are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa?”. There are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bell chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. How long does it take to climb the Tower? At this point, you might wonder how long it takes to climb the 257 steps inside the Tower and get a chance to see its seven bells... It took us about 20 minutes to climb up to the top of the monument, including the time for taking a few photos and dealing with the \"traffic\" inside the Tower. Getting down is about four times faster. The video below was shot on our way down and you can clearly see ALL the steps of the 4th and 3rd staircase... so you can crosscheck our numbers :) Is it worth climbing the Leaning Tower? Entering the Tower is the best way to experience its famous lean.Climbing the main stairs enhances the feeling of \"wrong gravity\" even more as you wobble from left to right when spiraling around the Tower from the ground to the top of the 6th floor. It is definitely worth the time and the 18 EUR of the entrance ticket (see image below). Are there any regulations for visiting the Tower? You can visit the tower without a Guide. Entrance is scheduled in batches, every 15 minutes.Tickets must be purchased at the Ticket Office closeby the Tower. In alternative, you can get your ticket online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If you get the ticket on-site, you can expect a waiting time of 1-2 hours... therefore it is recommended to buy the ticket online. Make sure you show up at the entrance by the time shown on your ticket cause the tickets are valid only for the time printed on them and they are NOT refundable! NOTE: backpacks and purses are NOT allowed in the Tower and you must leave them in the lockers at the Ticket Office. You can drop them 15 minutes before your scheduled visit and you'll be given a key-card for retrieving them after the tour. Do you want to know more? ...keep reading...

Lienhard Click here for audio of Episode 376. Today, we visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Medieval architects outreached themselves. The Gothic buildings that stand are a remarkable legacy. But we don't see the failures. Well, that isn't entirely so. We see a few. In fact one failure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is a marvel to see. The Leaning Tower, like many other old Tuscan towers, sits on soft soil. It's only one of many that've gone askew in various ways. But none is more dramatic. Its height, after 800 years of tilting and sinking into the soil, is about 184 feet. I always thought of the Tower as a Renaissance building, but it's older than that. Its construction began way back in 1173. When builders finished the first third, they found it'd tipped 0.2 degrees to the northwest. So they put it on hold for a century. By then the tilt had extended to 0.7 degrees. Yet the city fathers resumed construction anyway. Masons squared off the top of the tilted stump and built upward. The Tower tilted again, this time to the north. They stopped again. For another century the Tower sank and tilted — to the north, to the east, and finally to the south. With the Tower now leaning almost 2 degrees to the south, work went ahead once more in 1373. Masons squared off the top a second time and finished the Tower. Now the top was straight, but the lower portion had a gentle but permanent corkscrew shape. The Tower has continued tilting at an average rate of 21 seconds each year. Now it moves only 7 seconds per year, but that's cold comfort when it leans almost 5½ degrees off vertical — nearly a 10% tilt. And so it stands, majestic and eerie -- defying the rules of fall that Galileo was supposed to have learned on its summit. Walk with me to the top. The stair coils about the outside. You cringe against the wall each time you negotiate the south face and hang over empty space. You reach the summit, short of wind, and gaze out over the ancient intellectual center of Pisa. But there's one more tight circular staircase. Take a deep breath and mount it. Now you gaze down, even on the bells. Nothing more separates you from the blue Tuscan sky. And all the time you wonder what medieval magic keeps the Tower from abruptly finishing its fall while you stand there. Civil engineers have learned what its medieval builders did not know about foundations, but they haven't learned to end the Tower's movement. With an animal obstinacy, it curbs experiments. It responds to each measure by tilting faster. It teases our minds with its crazy, slow-motion, corkscrew fall. I'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work. (Theme music) Kerisel, J., A Few Hidden Errors in Medieval Architecture. Down to Earth.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day.

Its construction was an ambitious project to create a 358-metre (1,175 ft)-high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the \"Great Tower of London\", it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park's emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium. Contents 1 Names 2 History 2.1 Design and construction 2.2 Opening and demolition 3 Legacy 4 References 5 External links Names[edit] Numerous names and nicknames were given to the tower during its planning, construction and legacy. These include Watkin's Tower,[2] Watkin's Folly,[3] the Wembley Park Tower,[4] the Wembley Tower,[1] the Metropolitan Tower,[4] and the London Stump.[5] History[edit] A caricature of Watkin by \"Ape\", published in Vanity Fair in 1875. Sir Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur, noted for being chairman of nine different British railway companies. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line, which was designed to accommodate the larger continental European trains which would cross into Britain from France. Although the channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.[6] Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park) in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin's amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.[6][7] The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893-4.[8] Design and construction[edit] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The winning design of Watkin's Tower (proposal n°37), later scrapped and replaced by a four-legged designThe final four-legged design of Watkin's Tower (shown with the Eiffel Tower for comparison purposes) Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people \"would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.\"[5] An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Tower of Pisa; a structure with \"a captive parachute to hold four persons\"; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a \"colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens\".[5] The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged 1,200-foot (366 m) metal tower – 45.8 metres (150 ft) taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was 312.2 metres (1,024 ft) at the time.[9][10] It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Turkish baths[3] and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.[6][11] Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.[1][7] Opening and demolition[edit] The first and only completed stage of Watkin's Wembley Tower (c.1900) Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 metres (154 ft) high.[7] At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower's legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.[1][4] Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the \"unsafe\" site was closed to the public the following year.[3] The completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite in 1904 to 1907.[3][12] Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin's star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to house building and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.[7] After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin's Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923, and later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.[5] A comparative diagram of Watkin's Tower with the Eiffel tower and London buildings Legacy[edit] Blackpool Tower (erected 1894) Wembley Park station, originally opened to bring visitors to Watkin's Tower Watkin's Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing. Although Watkin's tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines. A large Irish pub and restaurant in the area is called Watkin's Folly. The story of Watkin's Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, Metro-land. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin's vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London: “ Beyond Neasden there was an unimportant hamlet where for years the Metropolitan didn't stop. Wembley. Slushy fields and grass farms. Then out of the mist arose Sir Edward Watkin's dream: an Eiffel Tower for London. ” — Sir John Betjeman, Metro-Land The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for Metro-land can be found in Betjeman's England, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.[13] References[edit] Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-7195-3857-2 ^ a b c d Spencer, Adam (1995).

The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

To be honest, I’m just not really sure what all the fuss is about. It’s just one of the hundreds of towers found throughout Italy, except this one happens to be leaning. In fact, this is not the only leaning tower in Italy! I distinctly recall seeing one in Venice and another on the island of Burano. A little research tells me that there are actually seven leaning towers in Italy, and three of them are located in Venice. So take that Pisa. Would I incorporate Pisa into a planned itinerary? No! If I am in the vicinity would I make an effort to see it? Absolutely! So the obvious question is should you make the time to get to Pisa to see this famous Italian landmark, and is it worth the effort? The answer really depends on where you are coming from and how much time, energy, and money you are willing to spend to see it. To be honest, there are plenty of other interesting sites to see across Italy, so dedicating half a day to a full day just to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa means less time spent elsewhere. On the flip side, we are all tourists at heart, and certainly, there is something about this tower that lures visitors from all over the world, so why not see it? I will tell you that I have actually been to Pisa twice to see the tower. Neither visit was really planned, but because we were close by, it was easy to get to and we figured we might as well see it. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134478_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Piazza die Miracoli\" title=\"Piazza die Miracoli\"/>Piazza die Miracoli | Source What Is There to See Besides the Tower?The entire tower complex is known as the Piazza die Miracoli, or the Field of Miracles. Four buildings make up the complex, including the Bell Tower (Campanile), the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the cloister that encloses part of the cemetery. The Cathedral of Pisa—one of Italy’s Grand Cathedrals—is a magnificent building that was started in 1063 and completed in 1092, almost 80 years before construction began on the tower. The entire complex is contained within a walled area and is very compact with everything within close proximity to each other. If you venture outside of the complex in search of interesting sites, I’m afraid there is not a great deal to see, at least in my opinion. There is the Botanical Garden, the Piazza del Cavalieri, and a scenic path along the Arno River, but most visitors seem interested in seeing just the tower. I've been to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower, and it's leaning.

It is certainly one of Italy’s most popular attractions, and it draws visitors from all over the world. It’s actually a lot of fun to people watch the crowds in the complex as they try to get their photos and selfies. Like it or not, this tower is a part of Italy’s legacy, and the community of Pisa has gone to great lengths to preserve the tower and make sure that it is safe for visitors to view and climb. Interesting Tower FactsConstruction started in 1173 and finished in 1399. The tower was originally planned to be 60 meters tall. Its height today is 56.67 meters on the high side and 55.86 meters on the low side. Surprisingly, there is confusion and controversy over the number of steps to the top. Various websites range from 250 to 297, which seems like a large margin of error. According to a website I found where they actually counted the steps while filming the ascent, there are 269 steps to the top of the tower. I believe this number is correct. The tower has eight stories, which includes the top floor bell chamber. There are seven bells in the tower, one for each note on the musical major scale. The tower is leaning due to the soft and unstable clay soil upon which it was built, and an inadequate foundation. By 1178, as construction reached the third story, the tower had already begun to lean. A renovation project to secure the tower was completed in 2001. This project made the tower safe for visitors to climb. The engineers that worked on the tower renovation project believe that it is possible to totally straighten it. However, nobody really wants that to happen, especially the community of Pisa that has lived off of the six million annual visitors to the tower for a very long time. Prior to the restoration project, the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees, it now leans at an angle of about 3.99 degrees. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134484_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Cathedral of Pisa\" title=\"Cathedral of Pisa\"/>Cathedral of Pisa | Source Visitor InformationHours:​​ April to Sept: 9 am to 8 pm, except open until 10 pm mid-June through Aug. ​​October: 9 am to 7 pm. ​​November: 9 am to 6 pm. ​​December to February: 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. ​​March: 9 am to 6 pm, 7 pm the last week of the month.

It is accessible by train from Lucca, Florence, and Rome. The trip from Lucca is just 30 minutes, while Florence is about an hour away. How Much Time Should You Spend in Pisa? Expect to spend a few hours to visit the entire tower complex and to take your photos. If you are coming from Lucca or Florence you can definitely do this in half a day and be back in time to enjoy other sites. Rome, while further away, is still doable and will take approximately two and a half hours by train. Should you be arriving by car, there is plenty of parking surrounding the complex. Some of it is free and some requires a fee. If you are arriving by train at the Pisa Central Station, be aware that the tower complex is 2 kilometers away, about a 25-minute walk or a 10-euro taxi ride. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134340_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"2448\" data-height=\"3264\" alt=\"Even I got in on the fun.\" title=\"Even I got in on the fun.\"/>Even I got in on the fun. | Source Our First VisitI mentioned earlier that we have seen the Leaning Tower of Pisa twice. The first time we were staying in a small village called Montemagno. It’s in the hills outside of Pisa and my very first glimpse of the tower was from our B&B window using a long telephoto lens. It was great fun to spot it from about seven miles away, albeit was small and distant. We did get into Pisa on that trip and what I took from that visit was that it is definitely over-hyped, yet a lot of fun to actually see it and create funny photos doing stupid things in front of the tower. This is of course why so many people want to see it, so they can take that coveted selfie or photo struggling to right the tower before it collapses. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134494_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\" title=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\"/>It’a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture. | Source Our Second VisitOur second visit to Pisa was much more recent, and this time we came from Lucca. Pisa is, in fact, a very easy day-trip from Lucca for those who want to get there, see it, and get out of there. Lucca, by the way, is absolutely beautiful and has lots of towers that are higher and just as interesting, in case you were interested. Lucca is a mere 12 miles north of Pisa and a very easy 30-minute train ride away. If your travels are taking you to Lucca, definitely consider taking a few hours to visit Pisa. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14139410_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source <img src=\"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14134479_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source So why did we return to see the tower a second time? We were traveling with friends who had not seen it, and being so close, you can hardly ignore its drawing power. The entire complex, which is contained within a high wall to hide its treasures, can be accessed through a couple of gates. The price you will pay to enter, which is free, is a run through the gauntlet of vendors trying to sell you Pisa trinkets and souvenirs. It’s actually an unwelcome and somewhat tacky introduction to the complex. Once you manage to slither through, however, I think you will be impressed, as I was, at the beautiful green grass that carpets the complex and the stunning cathedral before you. And yes, located just behind the cathedral is the tower that leans, the reason you are here.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

We’ll look at how structures connect to the ground and transmit loads through their foundations, and how those foundations need to provide a high bearing capacity. We’ll see how properties of the soil, like shear strength, affect bearing capacity. We’ll also consider happens when the ground experiences stress from seismic activity and how seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.Crash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Subscribe to Hot Mess: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaE...***RESOURCES:https://www.thebalancesmb.com/leaning...http://environment.uwe.ac.uk/geocal/f...http://www.geotechnicalinfo.com/beari...http://civil.utm.my/azril/files/2016/...http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~cnan/Princi...https://icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/in...https://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schoo...https://www.ramjack.com/houston/about...https://leaningtowerpisa.com/facts/ho...***Crash Course is on Patreon!

Just one little miscalculation made in the 11th century left us with an amazing 14,500 ton leaning tower! Known among Italians as Torre Pendente di Pisa, this piece of architecture is significally different from most medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is located on the city’s main square, Piazza del Duomo. This square is also known as Piazza dei Miracoli, “Miracles’ Square”, a name given by Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 1987 the whole square became one of the many Italian UNESCO World Heritage sites! The leaning tower is the third oldest building built in the square, after the wonderful Cathedral and its Baptistry. With its many columns and archs, this tower boasts an advanced knowledge of weight and load characteristics, showing the Italian architectures’ expertise. Why is the tower leaning then? What the architect didn’t account for was the base of the tower, which was built on a dense section of clay… The Early Years of the Leaning Tower of Pisa The construction of the Tower began in 1173. Originally designed to be a bell tower, it stood upright for over 5 years, but when the third floorwas completed in 1178 it began to lean. Italians were shocked by the event, as the tower began to lean ever so slightly. The thing is the foundation of the tower, which is only 3-meter deep, was built on a dense clay mixture. This mix impacted the soil and furthermore the clay was not strong enough to hold the tower upright. As a result the weight of the tower began to diffuse downward until it had found the weakest point. Due to this problem, construction works stopped for 100 years. The government decided to focus on its war with Genoa and hope that the soil would settle in the meantime. Mistake after mistake! After 100 years, engineer Giovanni di Simone stepped forward and started to add more floors to the tower. He tried to compensate for the original lean by making one side of the upper floors taller than the other. This only caused the tower to lean over even more… Unconcerned by the leaning, the tower was added a 7th floor in the second part of the 14th century, as well as a bell tower, and then the tower was left on its own until the 19th century. In 1838 architect Alessandro Della Gherardesca, dug a pathway at the base of the tower to allow people to admire the intricately crafted base. This caused the tower to lean even more, probably due to the digging of its base. Tower survives World War II World War II caused destruction all over the World. The leaning tower of Pisa, however, was very very lucky. In fact when American soldiers invaded Pisa, they were ordered to destroy all buildings as to prevent enemy snipers to find suitable places to hide. There were no exceptions to this rule, and many buildings were blown up everyday, as the US forces advanced over the Italian countryside. However a retreat took place shortly after the arrival of the Americans, making unnecessary to destroy the Leaning Tower of Pisa! And it is still standing! Twenty years after the end of the war Italy asked help to avoid the Leaning Tower from toppling. They didn’t want the tower to lose its leaning though, because it is now the symbol of the city, a landmark loved by tourists from all over the world. As a temporary measure engineers and architects installed a leaden counterweight of 800 tonnes. In 1987 the Leaning Tower of Pisa was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, together with the entire Piazza Del Duomo, but in 1990 it was closed. Its bells were removed and the tower was anchored, only to reopen in 2001.Tourists now can safely visit the leaning tower of Pisa!

Like its name suggest, it actually does lean to one side. The tower started to lean during construction because the foundation was built on soft ground that had difficulty supporting the weight. The lean became worse as construction continued for several decades. Between 1990 and 2001 it was stabilized and the lean was partially fixed. Interesting Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts: In Italian the Leaning Tower of Pisa is Torre pendente di Pisa. It was built as a freestanding bell tower for the cathedral in Pisa. On the side where the tower is lower because of the lean it stands at 187.27 feet. On the high side of the tower it stands at 186 feet. The tower weighs about 14,500 tons. That's a lot of weight for a building to have to support when it has been leaning since it was built. There are approximately 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side of the tower. The Leaning Tower of Pisa took 344 years to build, beginning in August 1173. It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground. The construction was stopped twice, the first time for 100 years, the second time in 1284. Both times it was due to wars. If it hadn't been for the two pauses in construction it would have taken between 185 and 195 years to complete. Inside the tower there are seven bells. Each bell represents one note of the musical major scale. The first stones used to form the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa were purchased with the money left to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie by Donna Berta di Bernardo in 1172. Nobody seems to be able to pinpoint the identity of who the actual original architect really was. During World War II, the Allies heard that Germans were using the Leaning Tower of Pisa as an observation post. Once the Allies saw how beautiful the tower was they refrained from destroying it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Also included in this designation were the cathedral, cemetery and the baptistery. In 1989 another tower called the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed. This sped up the restoration efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower was closed to the public from 1989 until 2001, after the restoration was complete. It is thought that the restoration will keep the Leaning Tower of Pisa stable for at 300 years more. In 2008 engineers stated that the Tower had stopped moving. This is the first time in its history that it has not been slowly leaning further to one side. If the construction of the tower had not been halted the first time due to war it would have toppled over. The hundred years it had to sit helped to let it settle (compact). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a circular shape and has eight floors. The 7 bells are located on the eighth floor. Some people have suggested that the tower should be straightened. The people have Pisa had said they would rather see it fall over than be straightened. After all, how could you call it the Leaning Tower of Pisa if it didn't lean? medianet_width = \"600\"; medianet_height = \"280\"; medianet_crid = \"426465885\"; medianet_versionId = \"3111299\"; Related Links: Facts Wonders of the World Facts Animals Facts (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <a href=\"http://www.softschools.com/facts/wonders_of_the_world/leaning_tower_of_pisa_facts/93/\">Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts</a> var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\"); document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\")); var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-286169-1\"); pageTracker._initData(); pageTracker._trackPageview(); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-2\"); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-3'); }); More Topics Handwriting Spanish Facts Examples Formulas Difference Between Inventions Literature Flashcards 2019 Calendar Online Calculators Multiplication Educational Videos"}],"keywords":["description"]},{"url":"https://www.livitaly.com/leaning-tower-of-pisa-history/","title":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours","sections":[{"title":"main","content":"Italy Travel Blog The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours April 18, 2018 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures in Italy & the world, so it’s little surprise that it draws in over 1 million visitors each year to see and take photos with the amazing monument. It has been depicted in numerous books, movies, and cartoons, so it’s little surprise that there are so many stories and tales about the tower. This stunning structure stands (or leans) in the city of Pisa, which is a short ride from Florence, the capital city of central Italy’s Tuscany region. The tower is the third oldest structure in the city’s Piazza del Duomo, or “Cathedral Square” in English. Most people are familiar with the tower from seeing photographs of their friends and family posing next to them (don’t worry we have all done it) but many don’t know much more about the intriguing history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Leaning Tower of Pisa History As the city of Pisa grew as an important Italian seaport, its people wanted to emphasize its significance with a cathedral complex. This so-called “Field of Miracles” included a baptistery, a cathedral & of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was then built to serve as the bell tower. Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1137, but it was not completed until the mid-14th century due to war, debt, and other interruptions which stalled its construction. Trying to find out the exact history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a little bit more complex than you may think. The design of the tower has historically been attributed to the 12th century Italian artist Bonanno Pisano, who was most well-known for his bronze castings. While his name was found in a shard of cast at the foot of the tower in the early 19th century, some historians argue that this is not evidence of his contribution and that the cast may instead be related to the cathedral that was destroyed in the late 16th century. In more recent times, some researchers have suggested that Diotisalvi might have been the original architect, because he designed the Baptistery and the bell tower of San Nicola in Pisa, and all of these works show some resemblance to each other. Guglielmo has been said to have lain the foundations of the tower, and a builder named Gerardo di Gerardo has also been credited with the early phases of construction. Giovani di Simone was involved in the second phase and Tommaso Pisano in the final phase.

So obviously everyone knows the tower because it leans – but the tower was not purposefully designed to lean. Due to the soft ground that the tower was built on and shifting soil upon which it was built, it served to destabilize the foundation. The tower had begun to lean by the time its builders reached the third story. Over time, it began to fall about two millimeters per year, until it was leaning at an angle of 5.5 degrees. Restoration work has taken place in the late 20th century to make sure that the tower doesn’t fall over, however, the leaning tower of Pisa now leans a little less than 4 degrees. It is now thought that the tower will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries but in fact, it may never fall. In the wake of this careful restoration project and the attraction’s re-opening, there has never been a better time to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa! How Was the Leaning Tower of Pisa Used? In legend, Galileo used the tower to prove that the speed of a falling object is independent of its mass. He supposedly dropped different weights of cannonballs from the top of the tower. The Germans were also suspected to have used the tower for observation during the Second World War. Eventually it became a major tourist attraction, full of people attempting to take the perfect photo. The Leaning Tower was closed to the public from 1990-2001 for stabilization, but it has since been reopened. The tower was on the brink of collapse not long ago. However, because of the restoration project conducted in the 1990s, which called upon the expertise of mathematicians, scientists, architects, and other talents, it is now thought that the Tower of Pisa will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries. In fact, it may never fall. Kathleen Bello I am so grateful to find your particular post.

As a vital seaport and a major center of trade, many people visited the city. In the early days, Pisa was a popular resting place for pilgrims from Europe on their way to Jerusalem. The military fleet of Pisa was most successful. In 871 the fleet helped defend the Salerno from attackers, and it was Pisans that forced the Arab troops from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia in 1015. The city of Pisa, Italy As their riches and influence increased, the city of Pisa, Italy, became more and more powerful. The island of Corsica came under Pisan control in 1077, and in 1113 so did the Balearic Islands near Spain. The Pisans enjoyed a time of great prosperity The decline of Pisa began in 1284 when Genoa defeated the Pisans in battle. The islands controlled by Pisa were lost and the influence began to decline. By the 15th century the Arno River had become so filled with silt that it completely cut off Pisa from the sea. This marked the end of Pisa as a useful port and the end of its wealth and power. Pisa Tower Construction In 1174, engineer Bonnano Pisano laid a marble foundation large enough to park about 16 Ferrari 328s in and started building the campanile for the cathedral and baptistry of Pisa. The Romanesque Tower of Pisa, comprising 14,000 tonnes of white marble, was completed 176 years later – but it was also embarrassingly crooked. Because there was a lot of water under the ground in this area, Bonnano was able to place the foundation only about 10 feet down into the ground. As the first story of the tower was completed, the south side began to sink. The builders tried to make it look better by building the columns and arches on the south side about an inch taller than those on the north side. However by the time they got to the fourth story, they had to make the southern columns 2 inches taller than the northern ones. The tower just continued to lean, and because of the difficulties the construction was stopped. Pisa Tower Architecture In 1234, the architect Benenato discovered that the tower was leaning even more. Now the south side of the fourth story was a full 6 inches shorter than the north side. He added a fifth story, again making the south columns taller than the north ones. After adding that one story, Benenato gave up, and again construction on the tower stopped. Almost thirty years later, in 1260, William of Innsbruck added the sixth and seventh stories to the Tower of Pisa. In 1350 Tommaso Pisano started work on the eighth story of the tower, the bell chamber. He found that the tower was still sinking, and so he made the spiral stairs inside the tower and the wall of the bell chamber higher on the south side than on the north. The tower was finally completed in 1372, almost 200 years after it was begun, and it was still leaning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

2018Original:Dec 3, 2015Why does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean?Author:Sarah PruittPick any day in the Piazza del Duomo in the Italian city of Pisa, and you will undoubtedly spot a bunch of tourists posing for the same photo: hands outstretched towards the cathedral’s conspicuously tilting bell tower, as if they are supporting it with their sheer strength. The so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world, although maybe not for the reasons its original architects would have wanted. In 1173, construction began on a white marble bell tower for the cathedral complex in Pisa, located between the Arno and Serchio rivers in Tuscany, central Italy. By the time builders had finished the third of eight planned stories about five years later, the tower’s foundation had begun to settle unevenly on the ground beneath it, a dense mixture of clay, sand and shells. As a result, the structure had begun to tilt visibly toward the south. Shortly after that, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, another Italian city-state, halting construction for nearly a century. This delay allowed the foundation to settle further, likely prevented the bell tower’s premature collapse. When construction resumed, chief engineer Giovanni di Simone tried to compensate for the lean by adding extra masonry to the short side, but the additional weight caused the structure to tilt even further. The tower was officially completed around 1370, but its lean only increased over the next six centuries, becoming an integral part of the monument’s quirky appeal. Despite various attempts to reinforce it, Pisa’s tower continued to subside at a rate of some 0.05 inches per year, placing it in increasing danger of collapse. By 1990, it was leaning 5.5 degrees (or some 15 feet) from the perpendicular–the most extreme angle yet. That year, the monument was closed to visitors and the bells removed as engineers started extensive reparations to stabilize it. By siphoning earth from beneath and adding counterweights to the tower’s north end, they were able to reduce the lean to 13.5 feet, or 4.0 degrees from perpendicular. The straightening continued after the tower reopened in 2001, and in 2008 sensors showed the subsiding motion had stopped, after a total improvement of some 19 inches. Engineers now believe the Leaning Tower of Pisa will remain stable for some 200 years, barring an earthquake or other unpredictable disaster.Tagsterms:ItalyEngineeringBy Sarah PruittFACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

(Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) In 1990 an international team of engineers, mathematicians, and historians met on the Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Their task was to figure out how to save an 800-year-old historic building that was close to collapsing. The structure was then tilted by 5.5 degrees to one side. If something wasn't done soon, the world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa would come crashing to the ground. The structure was originally meant to simply be a free standing bell tower (or campanile) for the city of Pisa's cathedral. Such towers were commonly built in 10th century Italy to symbolize the town's power and economic wealth. Historians aren't sure who the structure's original architect might be. For many years it was thought to be Bonanno Pisano, a Pisa resident and artisan noted for creating a number of ornate bronze doors for cathedrals. However, scholars now suspect that Diotisalvi, who was the architect of Pisa's San Nicola bell tower and the city's baptistery, might actually be responsible. Seven Quick Facts Height: 183 feet, 3 inches (55.8m) Angle of tilt: 3.97 degrees - 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) off vertical Steps to top: 296 Construction: Started 1173, finished 1372 Function: Bell Tower for the Cathedral at Pisa, Italy Built of: Masonry and Marble Other: Contains 7 bells tuned to the major musical scale In either case we know that construction on the tower started in 1173 AD near the city's cathedral on a piece of land known as Piazza dei Miracoli (\"Square of Miracles\"). The tower was round and 52 feet (16m) in diameter at the base with a projected height of 191 feet (58m). The first level was to be taller than the rest and have an elaborate entry portal decorated with sculptures of monsters and animals. The second story would have open marble arcades with many columns. On top of that there would be five more levels with facades similar to the second story. Finally, the roof would be capped with a bell chamber designed to contain 7 bells. Imperfect from the Beginning By the time the third floor was finished in 1178, it was clear that the tower was leaning slightly to the northwest. The problem was that the foundation was only 10 feet (3m) deep and the soil underneath was soft and unstable. The citizens of Pisa decided to stop construction for a while and let the tower settle a bit with the hope that it would straighten itself out, or at least stop moving. In any case, several wars with neighboring towns required their attention. The tower now leans 3.97 degrees off of true.(Photo by Softeis.

In 1272, under the direction of Giovanni di Simone, construction resumed. To try and compensate for the tilt, he designed the upper stories so that they had one side slightly taller than the other. By the time the 7th floor was completed, it became apparent that the building was moving again and the lean increasing, this time to the south. In 1284 work was halted again due to another war. Finally, the bell tower was finished in 1372. Over the next few centuries the 7 bells would be installed in the bell chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale. The tower continued to move and by the 16th century it was a full 3 degrees off vertical. Pisa's campanile, however, wasn't the only European tower that was crooked. Over the years many of these collapsed or were replaced with newer structures. Pisa's tilted bell tower, however, survived and eventually became a major landmark not despite its lean, but because of it. In 1911 engineers began careful measurements of the tower's angle and realized that it was still moving at the rate of a 1/20 of an inch per year. In 1934 engineers working for the dictator Benito Mussolini - who found the tilt an offense to his Fascist ideals - attempted to correct the problem by injecting 200 tons of concrete under the foundation. This, however, just made the problem worse. By 1989 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees and its top was out of plumb by 17 feet (5m). Its predicament was underscored when a similar bell tower in the town of Pavia unexpectedly collapsed. Officials decided to close the Pisa's tower to visitors, evacuate the area under it and put together an international team to figure out how to save it. Fixing the Tower One of the seven bells housed in the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018)) Team member John Burland, a soil mechanics specialist from Imperial College London, wondered if removing soil from under the tower's northern foundation might help correct the tilt. After running a number of computer simulations, the team decided that such a strategy was their best bet. To keep the building from coming apart while they worked on it, a number of temporary measures were put in place. First, steel bands were wrapped around the first floor to support the masonry there. Then, 827 tons of lead weights were placed on the northern side of the building to act as a counter-balance. A concrete ring was also placed around the building at the third level connected to heavy steel cables anchored in the ground to keep the structure from any further southern movement. Finally the massive bells were removed to decrease the total weight of the building. With these measures in place, the team drilled a hole at an angle under the northern side of the tower to remove some earth. Over a number of years they repeated this procedure while measuring what it did to the tilt of the tower. A total of 41 holes were made removing 77 tons of soil causing the tower to move backwards toward a more stable position. By 2001 the tower had moved back to the same lean it had in the 1930's and officials decided it was safe to reopen the structure to visitors. The intention was never to straighten the tower completely. It still leans 3.97 degrees out of true with the top being 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) from vertical. The cables and other temporary measures have been removed. Engineers believe they have stabilized the tilt so that the tower should be safe for at least several hundred years, barring a major incident like an earthquake. Looking up at the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) That's a relief to the citizens of Pisa for whom the well-loved, but off-kilter tower is a world recognized icon for their town and a source of tourist dollars. The structure isn't only known for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. Galileo Galilei, the astronomer, is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball from the tower to prove that weight does not affect how fast an object falls. While his conjecture indeed proved true, historians have called into question whether he actually did his test from the top of the tower at Pisa. Even so, the tower remains strongly associated in people's minds with the great scientist. Why Does it Stand At All? One of the mysteries of the tower is not just why it leans, but why it continues to stand at all. The area around Pisa is subject to earthquakes and the tower has lived through at least four major quakes during its life, yet even as off-kilter as it is, it still stands. In 2018 a study led by Roma Tre University's Professor Camillo Nuti suggests that the reason it leans is the exact same reason it still stands. \"Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Pisa tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\" noted Professor George Mylonakis, from the University of Bristol, UK, who was a member of the team that worked on the study. According to the report the softness of the soil, combined with the stiffness of the tower, prevents it from resonating, or vibrating along, with the earthquake's ground motion and protects the structure from damage. In 1987 the tower, along with the associated cathedral, baptistery and cemetery, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower has also been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. Ironically, while the preservation efforts have saved the tower, they have also caused it to lose the title of the most crooked structure in the world, This distinction now goes to the leaning tower of Suurhusen, in Germany, which is 5.3 degrees out of true.

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

(c) 2006, SCALA, Florence / ART RESOURCE, N.Y., artres.com, scalarchives.com The tilt was even more pronounced before modern efforts at stabilization began, and by some accounts has reached 8-10 degrees in past centuries. But while stabilizing the tower has been important to its physical preservation, it may have negatively affected the church’s historical legacy. Since the Leaning Tower of Pisa was straightened out, several other buildings–mainly in Germany and Switzerland–have been vying for the slanted spotlight, as was humorously reported by the New York Times in 2012. However, no attempt at dethroning Pisa as home to the farthest leaning building has been as bold as that of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. Starting in 2007, the city began work on the Capital Gate, which rises at an 18-degree westward lean–more than four times that of the Leaning Tower of Pisa–along the city’s waterfront. The topography and skyline of Abu Dhabi and of other major cities on the Persian Gulf have been rapidly changing in the past decade, with projects for major museums and cultural centers, shopping malls, offices, and condominiums underway or already completed. In Abu Dhabi alone, two outposts of renowned art museums are in the works – a branch of the Louvre, and a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi designed, respectively, by the famed architects Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. RMJM Architects, Capital Gate; overview of the building from nearby mosque exterior, 2010, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Even amid this development, though, the Capital Gate (opened in 2011) remains a unique structure for its arresting form, and the engineering feats that allowed for it. The architectural firm behind the building, RMJM Architects, devised a complex system to ensure that the Capital Gate stays at its intended lean. The building was the first to use what is known as a ‘pre-cambered’ core. 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel were sculpted in the opposite direction of the building’s incline and placed slightly off-center at its base. As the building rose, this core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position to support the mammoth structure. Other design elements employed to reinforce the Capital Gate’s unique shape include a steel exoskeleton, supported by 490 piles drilled 100 feet underground. The interior of the building matches the exterior in opulence. The Capital Gate houses an exhibition center, 20,000 square meters of luxury office space, and a five-star Hyatt hotel. Guests lucky enough to stay in one of the Hyatt’s rooms are greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows displaying a panoramic view of the city through custom-built window paneling. A large, airy atrium fills the central 17th and 18th floors, and contains both a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge. The 18th floor is also where the ‘Splash’–a 320-meter metal element that sweeps down from the outside of the building and connects to the nearby Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre–is placed. More than a mere aesthetic flourish, the Splash turns into a canopy for the Centre’s outdoor grandstand, used for viewing parades and other national events. Unsurprisingly, the client behind both buildings is one in the same: the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC), a national body that oversees conferences and exhibitions.

The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair; the Unisphere in New York City is a relic of the 1964/5 event; and in 2010 the city of Shanghai completed the Expo Axis, featuring one of the world’s largest membrane roofs, to accommodate the 2010 year’s World Exposition. The Capital Gate’s metallic, undulating shape lends it–and in turn the events it hosts–a cutting-edge appearance at a time when this region is staking its claim as a future international center for business and culture. Despite its bid for dominance in the architectural monuments game, though, Pisa may still have Abu Dhabi beat. The Capital Gate was given the honor of the Guinness World Record for “farthest leaning man-made structure,” but unless something goes awry with its foundation (and let’s hope it doesn’t), Pisa still houses, arguably, the world’s quirkiest and most iconic slanted structure – tilted by human error, not meticulous design plans. – Hannah Stamler You may also be interested in: Contemporary Architecture in the United Arab Emirates Posted in Features Related Posts August 26, 2019 Browsing Artstor just got easier!

(Image: © Library of Congress) Experts say the famous tower at Pisa will lean for at least another 200 years. It may even stay upright well, almost upright forever. That's all thanks to a restoration project, which brought the tower back from the brink of collapse a decade ago.From the first moment of its construction on unstable subsurface soils in 1173, Pisa's bell tower tilted farther and farther to the south. Its early-onset lean even influenced the way it was built, as its architects tried to compensate by angling the structure northward, resulting in its being banana-shaped.A few ill-advised construction projects accelerated the Leaning Tower's invisibly slow fall during the past couple of centuries; it tilted 5.5 degrees, its acutest angle ever, in 1990. By all calculations, the tower should have toppled at just 5.44 degrees, but fortunately it defied the predictions of computer models just long enough for engineers to come up with a fix.Restoration work undertaken from 1999 to 2001 stabilized the tower. Engineers placed weights on the structure's north end, while at the same time extracting soil from below, causing it to slowly sink back in that direction.The Leaning Tower of Pisa still leans south, but now it does so at just 3.99 degrees. Barring a large earthquake or other unforeseen catastrophe, engineers believe it will stay put for at least a few hundred years.How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean?Why Are Construction Cranes So Dangerous?Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries, then join us on Facebook. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; var taboola_lists = []; function taboola_is_device(device) { if ((! device) || device === null || (typeof device) === 'undefined') return true if (device === 'amp') return false if (device === 'desktop' && window.screen.width >= 700) return true if (device === 'mobile' && window.screen.width < 700) return true return false } if (taboola_is_device(\"desktop\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-f\", container: \"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"mobile\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-g\", container: \"taboola-mobile-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mobile Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"amp\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-a\", container: \"\", placement: \"below-main-column\", target_type: \"\" }); } for(var i = 0; i < taboola_lists.length; i++){ _taboola.push(taboola_lists[i]); } Sign Up for e-mail newsletters Get breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky particles and more!

When we moved to our current location in 1959, the Leaning Tower was one of only four places in town where pizza was available. The price was moderate, with a large pizza ranging from $1.25 to $3.50. Although prices have risen, our pizza remains the same. In a time where corners are cut in the name of “progress”, our recipe hasn’t changed since the day we opened. We still make our own sauce, dough, and sausage, use only the freshest vegetables, herbs and spices, and top our pizza with 100% real cheese. Most other pizza establishments can not claim this standard. Tradition and Quality – This is what the Leaning Tower is made of. It has been our pleasure to serve you for the last sixty years.

How do we know? ...we went there and counted ourselves! Believe it or not, no one is reporting this fact right… neither Wikipedia nor Google and not even the signs in “Piazza dei Miracoli” in Pisa, where the Tower stands... or for better use of words, leans.So we went there and we counted the steps one by one ON VIDEO! We had the feeling something was wrong with the steps count when we noticed that practically every web page on the topic reports a different number.Figures range from 250 to 300 and it is very hard to understand who shall be trusted. There are 5 flights of stairs in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of which is spiraling around the entire building! As far as we can tell, THIS is the only article on the entire Internet reporting the correct number of steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. How can we be so sure? ...tired of mismatching numbers, we went to Pisa and climbed the Tower to count the steps with our own eyes!The figure we got is totally different from anything published online to this date. Yes, we feel your pain... the fact that one cannot really trust information found on the Internet is mind-boggling. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The video of our descent is at the bottom of this article... there you can see how the inside of the Tower looks like and you can even count the steps for yourself! The Stairs in the Leaning Tower First off, there are FIVE different stairs to get to the top of the Tower.Some are just a few steps to access the various parts of the Tower (1st, 2nd, 5th) and two of them are full-size spiral staircases (3rd and 4th) to move between the floors. <ul><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/45c18c7b22454c99e10c91d4bf6e3281.jpeg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/19e09108119c31304b49050bf0dd93ce.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-4.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/0bc58cd05538afd1e09b9f0226093702.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/415b2482fc65c03643b19772ea00ae81.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/b4736076b2b55b2354abcadeedd61a9d.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li></ul> The first stairs bring from the street level to the base of the Tower, about 150cm lower (5 feet).Once there, you have to climb a few steps to enter the Tower through it’s - one and only - entrance door.Let’s call this stairs nr #2. As you enter the monument, it strikes you… this thing is leaning big time! Like the rest of the Tower, the floor of the entrance room is inclined and you can feel it under your feet. The feeling you get is much stronger than what your eyes perceive from the outside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The inside of the Tower is hollow. There is only one room with virtually no ceiling. As a matter of fact, the ceiling is about 49m high, on the top of the 7th floor (image on the left). It feels big… and it feels so leaning… On the left of the entrance door, there is the main staircase that leads to the top. It is a spiral staircase that wraps clockwise around the Tower. This is the 3rd staircase you find in the monument (image below). The staircase is pretty narrow and people going up must stop giving the way to those coming down. The stairs climb at regular steps and they are interrupted at each floor by small intermediate landings. At each landing, there is an opening on the outside. Openings are door-sized and they are closed with metal grates to prevent visitors accessing the columns area and walking along the tiny edge… that’d be VERY dangerous. The main staircase ends right at the bottom of the 7th floor. Once you are up, you can walk around the entire circumference of the Tower and admire the wonderful view. You are now walking outside, in the space between the wall of the Tower and the columns of the 7th floor. This space is about 1 meter wide (3 feet) and, like the openings of the floors below, it is protected by metal grates installed right before the columns. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Getting to the Top To get to the top of the 7th floor you have to climb on more flight of stairs (the 4th in the Tower). This last spiral staircase is really tiny and two persons can hardly exchange the way. These stairs land at the base of the bells chamber (8th floor). To enter the bells chamber you have a fifth set of steps to climb (just a few steps). You are now standing inside the bells chamber, on the bottom of the 8th floor.This is the highest point allowed to visitors. There is another flight of tiny stairs that climb up to the very top of the Tower but it is closed to the public since it leads on the tiny edge of the top of the bells chamber (8th floor). You might be surprised to find out that the floor of the 8th story is perfectly flat… well, no wonders, it took 200 years to figure out how to make that happen and they eventually got it right. When you are on the top of the 7th floor you are standing on the tallest building in Pisa. The view is unobstructed in every direction, except for the West, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of majestic Cathedral which very top is the same height as the Tower. The number of Steps It is time to do the math on the actual steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The first flight of stairs has 8 steps (from street level to the base of the Tower) The second flight has 4 steps (from the base to the inside) On the main staircase there are: 58 steps to reach the 2nd floor 31 steps to reach the 3rd floor 30 steps to reach the 4th floor 30 steps to reach the 5th floor 32 steps to reach the 6th floor 36 steps to reach the 7th floor The fourth flight of stairs to go from the 7th to the 8th floor also counts 36 steps. Finally, there are 4 steps on the short ramp to access the bell chamber (on the 8th floor). Summing up, there are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bells chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. The grand total is 269 steps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, this number is 24 steps shorter of what published in the signs in the Square of Miracles, right below the Tower (293), 25-27 steps less than what stated by Wikipedia and 15 steps less than what answered by Google in its Answer box at the moment of writing. Hopefully, Google and Wikipedia will soon acknowledge this mistake and refer to this post as the correct source of information when it comes to the question “how many steps are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa?”. There are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bell chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. How long does it take to climb the Tower? At this point, you might wonder how long it takes to climb the 257 steps inside the Tower and get a chance to see its seven bells... It took us about 20 minutes to climb up to the top of the monument, including the time for taking a few photos and dealing with the \"traffic\" inside the Tower. Getting down is about four times faster. The video below was shot on our way down and you can clearly see ALL the steps of the 4th and 3rd staircase... so you can crosscheck our numbers :) Is it worth climbing the Leaning Tower? Entering the Tower is the best way to experience its famous lean.Climbing the main stairs enhances the feeling of \"wrong gravity\" even more as you wobble from left to right when spiraling around the Tower from the ground to the top of the 6th floor. It is definitely worth the time and the 18 EUR of the entrance ticket (see image below). Are there any regulations for visiting the Tower? You can visit the tower without a Guide. Entrance is scheduled in batches, every 15 minutes.Tickets must be purchased at the Ticket Office closeby the Tower. In alternative, you can get your ticket online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If you get the ticket on-site, you can expect a waiting time of 1-2 hours... therefore it is recommended to buy the ticket online. Make sure you show up at the entrance by the time shown on your ticket cause the tickets are valid only for the time printed on them and they are NOT refundable! NOTE: backpacks and purses are NOT allowed in the Tower and you must leave them in the lockers at the Ticket Office. You can drop them 15 minutes before your scheduled visit and you'll be given a key-card for retrieving them after the tour. Do you want to know more? ...keep reading...

Lienhard Click here for audio of Episode 376. Today, we visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Medieval architects outreached themselves. The Gothic buildings that stand are a remarkable legacy. But we don't see the failures. Well, that isn't entirely so. We see a few. In fact one failure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is a marvel to see. The Leaning Tower, like many other old Tuscan towers, sits on soft soil. It's only one of many that've gone askew in various ways. But none is more dramatic. Its height, after 800 years of tilting and sinking into the soil, is about 184 feet. I always thought of the Tower as a Renaissance building, but it's older than that. Its construction began way back in 1173. When builders finished the first third, they found it'd tipped 0.2 degrees to the northwest. So they put it on hold for a century. By then the tilt had extended to 0.7 degrees. Yet the city fathers resumed construction anyway. Masons squared off the top of the tilted stump and built upward. The Tower tilted again, this time to the north. They stopped again. For another century the Tower sank and tilted — to the north, to the east, and finally to the south. With the Tower now leaning almost 2 degrees to the south, work went ahead once more in 1373. Masons squared off the top a second time and finished the Tower. Now the top was straight, but the lower portion had a gentle but permanent corkscrew shape. The Tower has continued tilting at an average rate of 21 seconds each year. Now it moves only 7 seconds per year, but that's cold comfort when it leans almost 5½ degrees off vertical — nearly a 10% tilt. And so it stands, majestic and eerie -- defying the rules of fall that Galileo was supposed to have learned on its summit. Walk with me to the top. The stair coils about the outside. You cringe against the wall each time you negotiate the south face and hang over empty space. You reach the summit, short of wind, and gaze out over the ancient intellectual center of Pisa. But there's one more tight circular staircase. Take a deep breath and mount it. Now you gaze down, even on the bells. Nothing more separates you from the blue Tuscan sky. And all the time you wonder what medieval magic keeps the Tower from abruptly finishing its fall while you stand there. Civil engineers have learned what its medieval builders did not know about foundations, but they haven't learned to end the Tower's movement. With an animal obstinacy, it curbs experiments. It responds to each measure by tilting faster. It teases our minds with its crazy, slow-motion, corkscrew fall. I'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work. (Theme music) Kerisel, J., A Few Hidden Errors in Medieval Architecture. Down to Earth.

Three of its eight stories had been completed when the uneven settling of the building’s foundations in the soft ground became noticeable. At that time, war broke out between the Italian city-states, and construction was halted for almost a century. This pause allowed the tower’s foundation to settle and likely prevented its early collapse.Pisa, Leaning Tower ofBell chamber at the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.© Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Giovanni di Simone, the engineer in charge when construction resumed, sought to compensate for the lean by making the new stories slightly taller on the short side, but the extra masonry caused the structure to sink still further. The project was plagued with interruptions, as engineers sought solutions to the leaning problem, but the tower was ultimately topped out in the 14th century. Twin spiral staircases lined the tower’s interior, with 294 steps leading from the ground to the bell chamber (one staircase incorporates two additional steps to compensate for the tower’s lean). Over the next four centuries the tower’s seven bells were installed; the largest weighed more than 3,600 kg (nearly 8,000 pounds). By the early 20th century, however, the heavier bells were silenced, as it was believed that their movement could potentially worsen the tower’s lean.The foundations have been strengthened by the injection of cement grout and various types of bracing and reinforcement, but in the late 20th century the structure was still subsiding, at the rate of 0.05 inch (1.2 mm) per year, and was in danger of collapse. In 1990 the tower was closed and all the bells silenced as engineers undertook a major straightening project. Earth was siphoned from underneath the foundations, decreasing the lean by 17 inches (44 cm) to 13.5 feet (4.1 metres); the work was completed in May 2001, and the structure was reopened to visitors. The tower continued to straighten without further excavation, until in May 2008 sensors showed that the motion had finally stopped, at a total improvement of 19 inches (48 cm). Engineers expected the tower to remain stable for at least 200 years. Get unlimited access to all of Britannica’s trusted content.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

Its construction was an ambitious project to create a 358-metre (1,175 ft)-high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the \"Great Tower of London\", it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park's emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium.

He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line, which was designed to accommodate the larger continental European trains which would cross into Britain from France. Although the channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.[6] Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park) in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin's amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.[6][7] The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893-4.[8] Design and construction[edit] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The winning design of Watkin's Tower (proposal n°37), later scrapped and replaced by a four-legged designThe final four-legged design of Watkin's Tower (shown with the Eiffel Tower for comparison purposes) Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people \"would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.\"[5] An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Tower of Pisa; a structure with \"a captive parachute to hold four persons\"; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a \"colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens\".[5] The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged 1,200-foot (366 m) metal tower – 45.8 metres (150 ft) taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was 312.2 metres (1,024 ft) at the time.[9][10] It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Turkish baths[3] and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.[6][11] Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.[1][7] Opening and demolition[edit] The first and only completed stage of Watkin's Wembley Tower (c.1900) Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 metres (154 ft) high.[7] At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower's legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.[1][4] Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the \"unsafe\" site was closed to the public the following year.[3] The completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite in 1904 to 1907.[3][12] Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin's star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to house building and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.[7] After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin's Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923, and later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.[5] A comparative diagram of Watkin's Tower with the Eiffel tower and London buildings Legacy[edit] Blackpool Tower (erected 1894) Wembley Park station, originally opened to bring visitors to Watkin's Tower Watkin's Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing. Although Watkin's tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines. A large Irish pub and restaurant in the area is called Watkin's Folly. The story of Watkin's Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, Metro-land. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin's vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London: “ Beyond Neasden there was an unimportant hamlet where for years the Metropolitan didn't stop. Wembley. Slushy fields and grass farms. Then out of the mist arose Sir Edward Watkin's dream: an Eiffel Tower for London. ” — Sir John Betjeman, Metro-Land The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for Metro-land can be found in Betjeman's England, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.[13] References[edit] Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-7195-3857-2 ^ a b c d Spencer, Adam (1995).

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

To be honest, I’m just not really sure what all the fuss is about. It’s just one of the hundreds of towers found throughout Italy, except this one happens to be leaning. In fact, this is not the only leaning tower in Italy! I distinctly recall seeing one in Venice and another on the island of Burano. A little research tells me that there are actually seven leaning towers in Italy, and three of them are located in Venice. So take that Pisa. Would I incorporate Pisa into a planned itinerary? No! If I am in the vicinity would I make an effort to see it? Absolutely! So the obvious question is should you make the time to get to Pisa to see this famous Italian landmark, and is it worth the effort? The answer really depends on where you are coming from and how much time, energy, and money you are willing to spend to see it. To be honest, there are plenty of other interesting sites to see across Italy, so dedicating half a day to a full day just to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa means less time spent elsewhere. On the flip side, we are all tourists at heart, and certainly, there is something about this tower that lures visitors from all over the world, so why not see it? I will tell you that I have actually been to Pisa twice to see the tower. Neither visit was really planned, but because we were close by, it was easy to get to and we figured we might as well see it. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134478_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Piazza die Miracoli\" title=\"Piazza die Miracoli\"/>Piazza die Miracoli | Source What Is There to See Besides the Tower?The entire tower complex is known as the Piazza die Miracoli, or the Field of Miracles. Four buildings make up the complex, including the Bell Tower (Campanile), the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the cloister that encloses part of the cemetery. The Cathedral of Pisa—one of Italy’s Grand Cathedrals—is a magnificent building that was started in 1063 and completed in 1092, almost 80 years before construction began on the tower. The entire complex is contained within a walled area and is very compact with everything within close proximity to each other. If you venture outside of the complex in search of interesting sites, I’m afraid there is not a great deal to see, at least in my opinion. There is the Botanical Garden, the Piazza del Cavalieri, and a scenic path along the Arno River, but most visitors seem interested in seeing just the tower. I've been to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower, and it's leaning. You look at it, but nothing happens, so then you look for someplace to get a sandwich.— Danny DeVito <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134480_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"The Baptistery\" title=\"The Baptistery\"/>The Baptistery | Source <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134328_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"\"/>Source Hopefully, I haven’t swayed you out of visiting the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It is certainly one of Italy’s most popular attractions, and it draws visitors from all over the world. It’s actually a lot of fun to people watch the crowds in the complex as they try to get their photos and selfies. Like it or not, this tower is a part of Italy’s legacy, and the community of Pisa has gone to great lengths to preserve the tower and make sure that it is safe for visitors to view and climb. Interesting Tower FactsConstruction started in 1173 and finished in 1399. The tower was originally planned to be 60 meters tall. Its height today is 56.67 meters on the high side and 55.86 meters on the low side. Surprisingly, there is confusion and controversy over the number of steps to the top. Various websites range from 250 to 297, which seems like a large margin of error. According to a website I found where they actually counted the steps while filming the ascent, there are 269 steps to the top of the tower. I believe this number is correct. The tower has eight stories, which includes the top floor bell chamber. There are seven bells in the tower, one for each note on the musical major scale. The tower is leaning due to the soft and unstable clay soil upon which it was built, and an inadequate foundation. By 1178, as construction reached the third story, the tower had already begun to lean. A renovation project to secure the tower was completed in 2001. This project made the tower safe for visitors to climb. The engineers that worked on the tower renovation project believe that it is possible to totally straighten it. However, nobody really wants that to happen, especially the community of Pisa that has lived off of the six million annual visitors to the tower for a very long time. Prior to the restoration project, the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees, it now leans at an angle of about 3.99 degrees. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134484_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Cathedral of Pisa\" title=\"Cathedral of Pisa\"/>Cathedral of Pisa | Source Visitor InformationHours:​​ April to Sept: 9 am to 8 pm, except open until 10 pm mid-June through Aug. ​​October: 9 am to 7 pm. ​​November: 9 am to 6 pm. ​​December to February: 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. ​​March: 9 am to 6 pm, 7 pm the last week of the month.

It is accessible by train from Lucca, Florence, and Rome. The trip from Lucca is just 30 minutes, while Florence is about an hour away. How Much Time Should You Spend in Pisa? Expect to spend a few hours to visit the entire tower complex and to take your photos. If you are coming from Lucca or Florence you can definitely do this in half a day and be back in time to enjoy other sites. Rome, while further away, is still doable and will take approximately two and a half hours by train. Should you be arriving by car, there is plenty of parking surrounding the complex. Some of it is free and some requires a fee. If you are arriving by train at the Pisa Central Station, be aware that the tower complex is 2 kilometers away, about a 25-minute walk or a 10-euro taxi ride. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134340_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"2448\" data-height=\"3264\" alt=\"Even I got in on the fun.\" title=\"Even I got in on the fun.\"/>Even I got in on the fun. | Source Our First VisitI mentioned earlier that we have seen the Leaning Tower of Pisa twice. The first time we were staying in a small village called Montemagno. It’s in the hills outside of Pisa and my very first glimpse of the tower was from our B&B window using a long telephoto lens. It was great fun to spot it from about seven miles away, albeit was small and distant. We did get into Pisa on that trip and what I took from that visit was that it is definitely over-hyped, yet a lot of fun to actually see it and create funny photos doing stupid things in front of the tower. This is of course why so many people want to see it, so they can take that coveted selfie or photo struggling to right the tower before it collapses. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134494_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\" title=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\"/>It’a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture. | Source Our Second VisitOur second visit to Pisa was much more recent, and this time we came from Lucca. Pisa is, in fact, a very easy day-trip from Lucca for those who want to get there, see it, and get out of there. Lucca, by the way, is absolutely beautiful and has lots of towers that are higher and just as interesting, in case you were interested. Lucca is a mere 12 miles north of Pisa and a very easy 30-minute train ride away. If your travels are taking you to Lucca, definitely consider taking a few hours to visit Pisa. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14139410_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source <img src=\"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14134479_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source So why did we return to see the tower a second time? We were traveling with friends who had not seen it, and being so close, you can hardly ignore its drawing power. The entire complex, which is contained within a high wall to hide its treasures, can be accessed through a couple of gates. The price you will pay to enter, which is free, is a run through the gauntlet of vendors trying to sell you Pisa trinkets and souvenirs. It’s actually an unwelcome and somewhat tacky introduction to the complex. Once you manage to slither through, however, I think you will be impressed, as I was, at the beautiful green grass that carpets the complex and the stunning cathedral before you. And yes, located just behind the cathedral is the tower that leans, the reason you are here.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

We’ll look at how structures connect to the ground and transmit loads through their foundations, and how those foundations need to provide a high bearing capacity. We’ll see how properties of the soil, like shear strength, affect bearing capacity. We’ll also consider happens when the ground experiences stress from seismic activity and how seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.Crash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Subscribe to Hot Mess: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaE...***RESOURCES:https://www.thebalancesmb.com/leaning...http://environment.uwe.ac.uk/geocal/f...http://www.geotechnicalinfo.com/beari...http://civil.utm.my/azril/files/2016/...http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~cnan/Princi...https://icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/in...https://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schoo...https://www.ramjack.com/houston/about...https://leaningtowerpisa.com/facts/ho...***Crash Course is on Patreon!

Just one little miscalculation made in the 11th century left us with an amazing 14,500 ton leaning tower! Known among Italians as Torre Pendente di Pisa, this piece of architecture is significally different from most medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is located on the city’s main square, Piazza del Duomo. This square is also known as Piazza dei Miracoli, “Miracles’ Square”, a name given by Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 1987 the whole square became one of the many Italian UNESCO World Heritage sites! The leaning tower is the third oldest building built in the square, after the wonderful Cathedral and its Baptistry. With its many columns and archs, this tower boasts an advanced knowledge of weight and load characteristics, showing the Italian architectures’ expertise. Why is the tower leaning then? What the architect didn’t account for was the base of the tower, which was built on a dense section of clay… The Early Years of the Leaning Tower of Pisa The construction of the Tower began in 1173. Originally designed to be a bell tower, it stood upright for over 5 years, but when the third floorwas completed in 1178 it began to lean. Italians were shocked by the event, as the tower began to lean ever so slightly. The thing is the foundation of the tower, which is only 3-meter deep, was built on a dense clay mixture. This mix impacted the soil and furthermore the clay was not strong enough to hold the tower upright. As a result the weight of the tower began to diffuse downward until it had found the weakest point. Due to this problem, construction works stopped for 100 years. The government decided to focus on its war with Genoa and hope that the soil would settle in the meantime. Mistake after mistake! After 100 years, engineer Giovanni di Simone stepped forward and started to add more floors to the tower. He tried to compensate for the original lean by making one side of the upper floors taller than the other. This only caused the tower to lean over even more… Unconcerned by the leaning, the tower was added a 7th floor in the second part of the 14th century, as well as a bell tower, and then the tower was left on its own until the 19th century. In 1838 architect Alessandro Della Gherardesca, dug a pathway at the base of the tower to allow people to admire the intricately crafted base. This caused the tower to lean even more, probably due to the digging of its base. Tower survives World War II World War II caused destruction all over the World. The leaning tower of Pisa, however, was very very lucky. In fact when American soldiers invaded Pisa, they were ordered to destroy all buildings as to prevent enemy snipers to find suitable places to hide. There were no exceptions to this rule, and many buildings were blown up everyday, as the US forces advanced over the Italian countryside. However a retreat took place shortly after the arrival of the Americans, making unnecessary to destroy the Leaning Tower of Pisa! And it is still standing! Twenty years after the end of the war Italy asked help to avoid the Leaning Tower from toppling. They didn’t want the tower to lose its leaning though, because it is now the symbol of the city, a landmark loved by tourists from all over the world. As a temporary measure engineers and architects installed a leaden counterweight of 800 tonnes. In 1987 the Leaning Tower of Pisa was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, together with the entire Piazza Del Duomo, but in 1990 it was closed. Its bells were removed and the tower was anchored, only to reopen in 2001.Tourists now can safely visit the leaning tower of Pisa!

Like its name suggest, it actually does lean to one side. The tower started to lean during construction because the foundation was built on soft ground that had difficulty supporting the weight. The lean became worse as construction continued for several decades. Between 1990 and 2001 it was stabilized and the lean was partially fixed. Interesting Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts: In Italian the Leaning Tower of Pisa is Torre pendente di Pisa. It was built as a freestanding bell tower for the cathedral in Pisa. On the side where the tower is lower because of the lean it stands at 187.27 feet. On the high side of the tower it stands at 186 feet. The tower weighs about 14,500 tons. That's a lot of weight for a building to have to support when it has been leaning since it was built. There are approximately 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side of the tower. The Leaning Tower of Pisa took 344 years to build, beginning in August 1173. It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground. The construction was stopped twice, the first time for 100 years, the second time in 1284. Both times it was due to wars. If it hadn't been for the two pauses in construction it would have taken between 185 and 195 years to complete. Inside the tower there are seven bells. Each bell represents one note of the musical major scale. The first stones used to form the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa were purchased with the money left to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie by Donna Berta di Bernardo in 1172. Nobody seems to be able to pinpoint the identity of who the actual original architect really was. During World War II, the Allies heard that Germans were using the Leaning Tower of Pisa as an observation post. Once the Allies saw how beautiful the tower was they refrained from destroying it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Also included in this designation were the cathedral, cemetery and the baptistery. In 1989 another tower called the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed. This sped up the restoration efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower was closed to the public from 1989 until 2001, after the restoration was complete. It is thought that the restoration will keep the Leaning Tower of Pisa stable for at 300 years more. In 2008 engineers stated that the Tower had stopped moving. This is the first time in its history that it has not been slowly leaning further to one side. If the construction of the tower had not been halted the first time due to war it would have toppled over. The hundred years it had to sit helped to let it settle (compact). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a circular shape and has eight floors. The 7 bells are located on the eighth floor. Some people have suggested that the tower should be straightened. The people have Pisa had said they would rather see it fall over than be straightened. After all, how could you call it the Leaning Tower of Pisa if it didn't lean? medianet_width = \"600\"; medianet_height = \"280\"; medianet_crid = \"426465885\"; medianet_versionId = \"3111299\"; Related Links: Facts Wonders of the World Facts Animals Facts (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <a href=\"http://www.softschools.com/facts/wonders_of_the_world/leaning_tower_of_pisa_facts/93/\">Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts</a> var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\"); document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\")); var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-286169-1\"); pageTracker._initData(); pageTracker._trackPageview(); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-2\"); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-3'); }); More Topics Handwriting Spanish Facts Examples Formulas Difference Between Inventions Literature Flashcards 2019 Calendar Online Calculators Multiplication Educational Videos"}],"keywords":["description"]},{"url":"https://www.livitaly.com/leaning-tower-of-pisa-history/","title":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours","sections":[{"title":"main","content":"Italy Travel Blog The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours April 18, 2018 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures in Italy & the world, so it’s little surprise that it draws in over 1 million visitors each year to see and take photos with the amazing monument. It has been depicted in numerous books, movies, and cartoons, so it’s little surprise that there are so many stories and tales about the tower. This stunning structure stands (or leans) in the city of Pisa, which is a short ride from Florence, the capital city of central Italy’s Tuscany region. The tower is the third oldest structure in the city’s Piazza del Duomo, or “Cathedral Square” in English. Most people are familiar with the tower from seeing photographs of their friends and family posing next to them (don’t worry we have all done it) but many don’t know much more about the intriguing history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Leaning Tower of Pisa History As the city of Pisa grew as an important Italian seaport, its people wanted to emphasize its significance with a cathedral complex. This so-called “Field of Miracles” included a baptistery, a cathedral & of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was then built to serve as the bell tower. Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1137, but it was not completed until the mid-14th century due to war, debt, and other interruptions which stalled its construction. Trying to find out the exact history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a little bit more complex than you may think. The design of the tower has historically been attributed to the 12th century Italian artist Bonanno Pisano, who was most well-known for his bronze castings. While his name was found in a shard of cast at the foot of the tower in the early 19th century, some historians argue that this is not evidence of his contribution and that the cast may instead be related to the cathedral that was destroyed in the late 16th century. In more recent times, some researchers have suggested that Diotisalvi might have been the original architect, because he designed the Baptistery and the bell tower of San Nicola in Pisa, and all of these works show some resemblance to each other. Guglielmo has been said to have lain the foundations of the tower, and a builder named Gerardo di Gerardo has also been credited with the early phases of construction. Giovani di Simone was involved in the second phase and Tommaso Pisano in the final phase.

So obviously everyone knows the tower because it leans – but the tower was not purposefully designed to lean. Due to the soft ground that the tower was built on and shifting soil upon which it was built, it served to destabilize the foundation. The tower had begun to lean by the time its builders reached the third story. Over time, it began to fall about two millimeters per year, until it was leaning at an angle of 5.5 degrees. Restoration work has taken place in the late 20th century to make sure that the tower doesn’t fall over, however, the leaning tower of Pisa now leans a little less than 4 degrees. It is now thought that the tower will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries but in fact, it may never fall. In the wake of this careful restoration project and the attraction’s re-opening, there has never been a better time to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa! How Was the Leaning Tower of Pisa Used? In legend, Galileo used the tower to prove that the speed of a falling object is independent of its mass. He supposedly dropped different weights of cannonballs from the top of the tower. The Germans were also suspected to have used the tower for observation during the Second World War. Eventually it became a major tourist attraction, full of people attempting to take the perfect photo. The Leaning Tower was closed to the public from 1990-2001 for stabilization, but it has since been reopened. The tower was on the brink of collapse not long ago. However, because of the restoration project conducted in the 1990s, which called upon the expertise of mathematicians, scientists, architects, and other talents, it is now thought that the Tower of Pisa will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries. In fact, it may never fall. Kathleen Bello I am so grateful to find your particular post.

As a vital seaport and a major center of trade, many people visited the city. In the early days, Pisa was a popular resting place for pilgrims from Europe on their way to Jerusalem. The military fleet of Pisa was most successful. In 871 the fleet helped defend the Salerno from attackers, and it was Pisans that forced the Arab troops from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia in 1015. The city of Pisa, Italy As their riches and influence increased, the city of Pisa, Italy, became more and more powerful. The island of Corsica came under Pisan control in 1077, and in 1113 so did the Balearic Islands near Spain. The Pisans enjoyed a time of great prosperity The decline of Pisa began in 1284 when Genoa defeated the Pisans in battle. The islands controlled by Pisa were lost and the influence began to decline. By the 15th century the Arno River had become so filled with silt that it completely cut off Pisa from the sea. This marked the end of Pisa as a useful port and the end of its wealth and power. Pisa Tower Construction In 1174, engineer Bonnano Pisano laid a marble foundation large enough to park about 16 Ferrari 328s in and started building the campanile for the cathedral and baptistry of Pisa. The Romanesque Tower of Pisa, comprising 14,000 tonnes of white marble, was completed 176 years later – but it was also embarrassingly crooked. Because there was a lot of water under the ground in this area, Bonnano was able to place the foundation only about 10 feet down into the ground. As the first story of the tower was completed, the south side began to sink. The builders tried to make it look better by building the columns and arches on the south side about an inch taller than those on the north side. However by the time they got to the fourth story, they had to make the southern columns 2 inches taller than the northern ones. The tower just continued to lean, and because of the difficulties the construction was stopped. Pisa Tower Architecture In 1234, the architect Benenato discovered that the tower was leaning even more. Now the south side of the fourth story was a full 6 inches shorter than the north side. He added a fifth story, again making the south columns taller than the north ones. After adding that one story, Benenato gave up, and again construction on the tower stopped. Almost thirty years later, in 1260, William of Innsbruck added the sixth and seventh stories to the Tower of Pisa. In 1350 Tommaso Pisano started work on the eighth story of the tower, the bell chamber. He found that the tower was still sinking, and so he made the spiral stairs inside the tower and the wall of the bell chamber higher on the south side than on the north. The tower was finally completed in 1372, almost 200 years after it was begun, and it was still leaning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

2018Original:Dec 3, 2015Why does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean?Author:Sarah PruittPick any day in the Piazza del Duomo in the Italian city of Pisa, and you will undoubtedly spot a bunch of tourists posing for the same photo: hands outstretched towards the cathedral’s conspicuously tilting bell tower, as if they are supporting it with their sheer strength. The so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world, although maybe not for the reasons its original architects would have wanted. In 1173, construction began on a white marble bell tower for the cathedral complex in Pisa, located between the Arno and Serchio rivers in Tuscany, central Italy. By the time builders had finished the third of eight planned stories about five years later, the tower’s foundation had begun to settle unevenly on the ground beneath it, a dense mixture of clay, sand and shells. As a result, the structure had begun to tilt visibly toward the south. Shortly after that, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, another Italian city-state, halting construction for nearly a century. This delay allowed the foundation to settle further, likely prevented the bell tower’s premature collapse. When construction resumed, chief engineer Giovanni di Simone tried to compensate for the lean by adding extra masonry to the short side, but the additional weight caused the structure to tilt even further. The tower was officially completed around 1370, but its lean only increased over the next six centuries, becoming an integral part of the monument’s quirky appeal. Despite various attempts to reinforce it, Pisa’s tower continued to subside at a rate of some 0.05 inches per year, placing it in increasing danger of collapse. By 1990, it was leaning 5.5 degrees (or some 15 feet) from the perpendicular–the most extreme angle yet. That year, the monument was closed to visitors and the bells removed as engineers started extensive reparations to stabilize it. By siphoning earth from beneath and adding counterweights to the tower’s north end, they were able to reduce the lean to 13.5 feet, or 4.0 degrees from perpendicular. The straightening continued after the tower reopened in 2001, and in 2008 sensors showed the subsiding motion had stopped, after a total improvement of some 19 inches. Engineers now believe the Leaning Tower of Pisa will remain stable for some 200 years, barring an earthquake or other unpredictable disaster.Tagsterms:ItalyEngineeringBy Sarah PruittFACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

(Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) In 1990 an international team of engineers, mathematicians, and historians met on the Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Their task was to figure out how to save an 800-year-old historic building that was close to collapsing. The structure was then tilted by 5.5 degrees to one side. If something wasn't done soon, the world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa would come crashing to the ground. The structure was originally meant to simply be a free standing bell tower (or campanile) for the city of Pisa's cathedral. Such towers were commonly built in 10th century Italy to symbolize the town's power and economic wealth. Historians aren't sure who the structure's original architect might be. For many years it was thought to be Bonanno Pisano, a Pisa resident and artisan noted for creating a number of ornate bronze doors for cathedrals. However, scholars now suspect that Diotisalvi, who was the architect of Pisa's San Nicola bell tower and the city's baptistery, might actually be responsible. Seven Quick Facts Height: 183 feet, 3 inches (55.8m) Angle of tilt: 3.97 degrees - 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) off vertical Steps to top: 296 Construction: Started 1173, finished 1372 Function: Bell Tower for the Cathedral at Pisa, Italy Built of: Masonry and Marble Other: Contains 7 bells tuned to the major musical scale In either case we know that construction on the tower started in 1173 AD near the city's cathedral on a piece of land known as Piazza dei Miracoli (\"Square of Miracles\"). The tower was round and 52 feet (16m) in diameter at the base with a projected height of 191 feet (58m). The first level was to be taller than the rest and have an elaborate entry portal decorated with sculptures of monsters and animals. The second story would have open marble arcades with many columns. On top of that there would be five more levels with facades similar to the second story. Finally, the roof would be capped with a bell chamber designed to contain 7 bells. Imperfect from the Beginning By the time the third floor was finished in 1178, it was clear that the tower was leaning slightly to the northwest. The problem was that the foundation was only 10 feet (3m) deep and the soil underneath was soft and unstable. The citizens of Pisa decided to stop construction for a while and let the tower settle a bit with the hope that it would straighten itself out, or at least stop moving. In any case, several wars with neighboring towns required their attention. The tower now leans 3.97 degrees off of true.(Photo by Softeis. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license) It was almost a hundred years before they got back to doing more work on it. In 1272, under the direction of Giovanni di Simone, construction resumed. To try and compensate for the tilt, he designed the upper stories so that they had one side slightly taller than the other. By the time the 7th floor was completed, it became apparent that the building was moving again and the lean increasing, this time to the south. In 1284 work was halted again due to another war. Finally, the bell tower was finished in 1372. Over the next few centuries the 7 bells would be installed in the bell chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale. The tower continued to move and by the 16th century it was a full 3 degrees off vertical. Pisa's campanile, however, wasn't the only European tower that was crooked. Over the years many of these collapsed or were replaced with newer structures. Pisa's tilted bell tower, however, survived and eventually became a major landmark not despite its lean, but because of it. In 1911 engineers began careful measurements of the tower's angle and realized that it was still moving at the rate of a 1/20 of an inch per year. In 1934 engineers working for the dictator Benito Mussolini - who found the tilt an offense to his Fascist ideals - attempted to correct the problem by injecting 200 tons of concrete under the foundation. This, however, just made the problem worse. By 1989 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees and its top was out of plumb by 17 feet (5m). Its predicament was underscored when a similar bell tower in the town of Pavia unexpectedly collapsed. Officials decided to close the Pisa's tower to visitors, evacuate the area under it and put together an international team to figure out how to save it. Fixing the Tower One of the seven bells housed in the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018)) Team member John Burland, a soil mechanics specialist from Imperial College London, wondered if removing soil from under the tower's northern foundation might help correct the tilt. After running a number of computer simulations, the team decided that such a strategy was their best bet. To keep the building from coming apart while they worked on it, a number of temporary measures were put in place. First, steel bands were wrapped around the first floor to support the masonry there. Then, 827 tons of lead weights were placed on the northern side of the building to act as a counter-balance. A concrete ring was also placed around the building at the third level connected to heavy steel cables anchored in the ground to keep the structure from any further southern movement. Finally the massive bells were removed to decrease the total weight of the building. With these measures in place, the team drilled a hole at an angle under the northern side of the tower to remove some earth. Over a number of years they repeated this procedure while measuring what it did to the tilt of the tower. A total of 41 holes were made removing 77 tons of soil causing the tower to move backwards toward a more stable position. By 2001 the tower had moved back to the same lean it had in the 1930's and officials decided it was safe to reopen the structure to visitors. The intention was never to straighten the tower completely. It still leans 3.97 degrees out of true with the top being 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) from vertical. The cables and other temporary measures have been removed. Engineers believe they have stabilized the tilt so that the tower should be safe for at least several hundred years, barring a major incident like an earthquake. Looking up at the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) That's a relief to the citizens of Pisa for whom the well-loved, but off-kilter tower is a world recognized icon for their town and a source of tourist dollars. The structure isn't only known for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. Galileo Galilei, the astronomer, is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball from the tower to prove that weight does not affect how fast an object falls. While his conjecture indeed proved true, historians have called into question whether he actually did his test from the top of the tower at Pisa. Even so, the tower remains strongly associated in people's minds with the great scientist. Why Does it Stand At All? One of the mysteries of the tower is not just why it leans, but why it continues to stand at all. The area around Pisa is subject to earthquakes and the tower has lived through at least four major quakes during its life, yet even as off-kilter as it is, it still stands. In 2018 a study led by Roma Tre University's Professor Camillo Nuti suggests that the reason it leans is the exact same reason it still stands. \"Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Pisa tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\" noted Professor George Mylonakis, from the University of Bristol, UK, who was a member of the team that worked on the study. According to the report the softness of the soil, combined with the stiffness of the tower, prevents it from resonating, or vibrating along, with the earthquake's ground motion and protects the structure from damage. In 1987 the tower, along with the associated cathedral, baptistery and cemetery, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower has also been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. Ironically, while the preservation efforts have saved the tower, they have also caused it to lose the title of the most crooked structure in the world, This distinction now goes to the leaning tower of Suurhusen, in Germany, which is 5.3 degrees out of true.

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

This is certainly true of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a monument striking for its tilt of approximately 4 degrees. Bonanno Pisano, Campanile (Leaning Tower), exterior, 1174-1350, Pisa, Italy. (c) 2006, SCALA, Florence / ART RESOURCE, N.Y., artres.com, scalarchives.com The tilt was even more pronounced before modern efforts at stabilization began, and by some accounts has reached 8-10 degrees in past centuries. But while stabilizing the tower has been important to its physical preservation, it may have negatively affected the church’s historical legacy. Since the Leaning Tower of Pisa was straightened out, several other buildings–mainly in Germany and Switzerland–have been vying for the slanted spotlight, as was humorously reported by the New York Times in 2012. However, no attempt at dethroning Pisa as home to the farthest leaning building has been as bold as that of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. Starting in 2007, the city began work on the Capital Gate, which rises at an 18-degree westward lean–more than four times that of the Leaning Tower of Pisa–along the city’s waterfront. The topography and skyline of Abu Dhabi and of other major cities on the Persian Gulf have been rapidly changing in the past decade, with projects for major museums and cultural centers, shopping malls, offices, and condominiums underway or already completed. In Abu Dhabi alone, two outposts of renowned art museums are in the works – a branch of the Louvre, and a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi designed, respectively, by the famed architects Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. RMJM Architects, Capital Gate; overview of the building from nearby mosque exterior, 2010, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Even amid this development, though, the Capital Gate (opened in 2011) remains a unique structure for its arresting form, and the engineering feats that allowed for it. The architectural firm behind the building, RMJM Architects, devised a complex system to ensure that the Capital Gate stays at its intended lean. The building was the first to use what is known as a ‘pre-cambered’ core. 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel were sculpted in the opposite direction of the building’s incline and placed slightly off-center at its base. As the building rose, this core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position to support the mammoth structure. Other design elements employed to reinforce the Capital Gate’s unique shape include a steel exoskeleton, supported by 490 piles drilled 100 feet underground. The interior of the building matches the exterior in opulence. The Capital Gate houses an exhibition center, 20,000 square meters of luxury office space, and a five-star Hyatt hotel. Guests lucky enough to stay in one of the Hyatt’s rooms are greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows displaying a panoramic view of the city through custom-built window paneling. A large, airy atrium fills the central 17th and 18th floors, and contains both a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge. The 18th floor is also where the ‘Splash’–a 320-meter metal element that sweeps down from the outside of the building and connects to the nearby Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre–is placed. More than a mere aesthetic flourish, the Splash turns into a canopy for the Centre’s outdoor grandstand, used for viewing parades and other national events. Unsurprisingly, the client behind both buildings is one in the same: the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC), a national body that oversees conferences and exhibitions.

Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Exhibitions have a way of inspiring futuristic architecture. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair; the Unisphere in New York City is a relic of the 1964/5 event; and in 2010 the city of Shanghai completed the Expo Axis, featuring one of the world’s largest membrane roofs, to accommodate the 2010 year’s World Exposition. The Capital Gate’s metallic, undulating shape lends it–and in turn the events it hosts–a cutting-edge appearance at a time when this region is staking its claim as a future international center for business and culture. Despite its bid for dominance in the architectural monuments game, though, Pisa may still have Abu Dhabi beat. The Capital Gate was given the honor of the Guinness World Record for “farthest leaning man-made structure,” but unless something goes awry with its foundation (and let’s hope it doesn’t), Pisa still houses, arguably, the world’s quirkiest and most iconic slanted structure – tilted by human error, not meticulous design plans. – Hannah Stamler You may also be interested in: Contemporary Architecture in the United Arab Emirates Posted in Features Related Posts August 26, 2019 Browsing Artstor just got easier!

(Image: © Library of Congress) Experts say the famous tower at Pisa will lean for at least another 200 years. It may even stay upright well, almost upright forever. That's all thanks to a restoration project, which brought the tower back from the brink of collapse a decade ago.From the first moment of its construction on unstable subsurface soils in 1173, Pisa's bell tower tilted farther and farther to the south. Its early-onset lean even influenced the way it was built, as its architects tried to compensate by angling the structure northward, resulting in its being banana-shaped.A few ill-advised construction projects accelerated the Leaning Tower's invisibly slow fall during the past couple of centuries; it tilted 5.5 degrees, its acutest angle ever, in 1990. By all calculations, the tower should have toppled at just 5.44 degrees, but fortunately it defied the predictions of computer models just long enough for engineers to come up with a fix.Restoration work undertaken from 1999 to 2001 stabilized the tower. Engineers placed weights on the structure's north end, while at the same time extracting soil from below, causing it to slowly sink back in that direction.The Leaning Tower of Pisa still leans south, but now it does so at just 3.99 degrees. Barring a large earthquake or other unforeseen catastrophe, engineers believe it will stay put for at least a few hundred years.How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean?Why Are Construction Cranes So Dangerous?Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries, then join us on Facebook. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; var taboola_lists = []; function taboola_is_device(device) { if ((! device) || device === null || (typeof device) === 'undefined') return true if (device === 'amp') return false if (device === 'desktop' && window.screen.width >= 700) return true if (device === 'mobile' && window.screen.width < 700) return true return false } if (taboola_is_device(\"desktop\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-f\", container: \"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"mobile\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-g\", container: \"taboola-mobile-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mobile Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"amp\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-a\", container: \"\", placement: \"below-main-column\", target_type: \"\" }); } for(var i = 0; i < taboola_lists.length; i++){ _taboola.push(taboola_lists[i]); } Sign Up for e-mail newsletters Get breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky particles and more!

When we moved to our current location in 1959, the Leaning Tower was one of only four places in town where pizza was available. The price was moderate, with a large pizza ranging from $1.25 to $3.50. Although prices have risen, our pizza remains the same. In a time where corners are cut in the name of “progress”, our recipe hasn’t changed since the day we opened. We still make our own sauce, dough, and sausage, use only the freshest vegetables, herbs and spices, and top our pizza with 100% real cheese.

How do we know? ...we went there and counted ourselves! Believe it or not, no one is reporting this fact right… neither Wikipedia nor Google and not even the signs in “Piazza dei Miracoli” in Pisa, where the Tower stands... or for better use of words, leans.So we went there and we counted the steps one by one ON VIDEO! We had the feeling something was wrong with the steps count when we noticed that practically every web page on the topic reports a different number.Figures range from 250 to 300 and it is very hard to understand who shall be trusted. There are 5 flights of stairs in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of which is spiraling around the entire building! As far as we can tell, THIS is the only article on the entire Internet reporting the correct number of steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. How can we be so sure? ...tired of mismatching numbers, we went to Pisa and climbed the Tower to count the steps with our own eyes!The figure we got is totally different from anything published online to this date. Yes, we feel your pain... the fact that one cannot really trust information found on the Internet is mind-boggling. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The video of our descent is at the bottom of this article... there you can see how the inside of the Tower looks like and you can even count the steps for yourself! The Stairs in the Leaning Tower First off, there are FIVE different stairs to get to the top of the Tower.Some are just a few steps to access the various parts of the Tower (1st, 2nd, 5th) and two of them are full-size spiral staircases (3rd and 4th) to move between the floors. <ul><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/45c18c7b22454c99e10c91d4bf6e3281.jpeg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/19e09108119c31304b49050bf0dd93ce.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-4.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/0bc58cd05538afd1e09b9f0226093702.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/415b2482fc65c03643b19772ea00ae81.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/b4736076b2b55b2354abcadeedd61a9d.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li></ul> The first stairs bring from the street level to the base of the Tower, about 150cm lower (5 feet).Once there, you have to climb a few steps to enter the Tower through it’s - one and only - entrance door.Let’s call this stairs nr #2. As you enter the monument, it strikes you… this thing is leaning big time! Like the rest of the Tower, the floor of the entrance room is inclined and you can feel it under your feet. The feeling you get is much stronger than what your eyes perceive from the outside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The inside of the Tower is hollow. There is only one room with virtually no ceiling. As a matter of fact, the ceiling is about 49m high, on the top of the 7th floor (image on the left). It feels big… and it feels so leaning… On the left of the entrance door, there is the main staircase that leads to the top. It is a spiral staircase that wraps clockwise around the Tower. This is the 3rd staircase you find in the monument (image below). The staircase is pretty narrow and people going up must stop giving the way to those coming down. The stairs climb at regular steps and they are interrupted at each floor by small intermediate landings. At each landing, there is an opening on the outside. Openings are door-sized and they are closed with metal grates to prevent visitors accessing the columns area and walking along the tiny edge… that’d be VERY dangerous. The main staircase ends right at the bottom of the 7th floor. Once you are up, you can walk around the entire circumference of the Tower and admire the wonderful view. You are now walking outside, in the space between the wall of the Tower and the columns of the 7th floor. This space is about 1 meter wide (3 feet) and, like the openings of the floors below, it is protected by metal grates installed right before the columns. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Getting to the Top To get to the top of the 7th floor you have to climb on more flight of stairs (the 4th in the Tower). This last spiral staircase is really tiny and two persons can hardly exchange the way. These stairs land at the base of the bells chamber (8th floor). To enter the bells chamber you have a fifth set of steps to climb (just a few steps). You are now standing inside the bells chamber, on the bottom of the 8th floor.This is the highest point allowed to visitors. There is another flight of tiny stairs that climb up to the very top of the Tower but it is closed to the public since it leads on the tiny edge of the top of the bells chamber (8th floor). You might be surprised to find out that the floor of the 8th story is perfectly flat… well, no wonders, it took 200 years to figure out how to make that happen and they eventually got it right. When you are on the top of the 7th floor you are standing on the tallest building in Pisa. The view is unobstructed in every direction, except for the West, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of majestic Cathedral which very top is the same height as the Tower. The number of Steps It is time to do the math on the actual steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The first flight of stairs has 8 steps (from street level to the base of the Tower) The second flight has 4 steps (from the base to the inside) On the main staircase there are: 58 steps to reach the 2nd floor 31 steps to reach the 3rd floor 30 steps to reach the 4th floor 30 steps to reach the 5th floor 32 steps to reach the 6th floor 36 steps to reach the 7th floor The fourth flight of stairs to go from the 7th to the 8th floor also counts 36 steps. Finally, there are 4 steps on the short ramp to access the bell chamber (on the 8th floor). Summing up, there are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bells chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. The grand total is 269 steps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, this number is 24 steps shorter of what published in the signs in the Square of Miracles, right below the Tower (293), 25-27 steps less than what stated by Wikipedia and 15 steps less than what answered by Google in its Answer box at the moment of writing. Hopefully, Google and Wikipedia will soon acknowledge this mistake and refer to this post as the correct source of information when it comes to the question “how many steps are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa?”. There are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bell chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. How long does it take to climb the Tower? At this point, you might wonder how long it takes to climb the 257 steps inside the Tower and get a chance to see its seven bells... It took us about 20 minutes to climb up to the top of the monument, including the time for taking a few photos and dealing with the \"traffic\" inside the Tower. Getting down is about four times faster. The video below was shot on our way down and you can clearly see ALL the steps of the 4th and 3rd staircase... so you can crosscheck our numbers :) Is it worth climbing the Leaning Tower? Entering the Tower is the best way to experience its famous lean.Climbing the main stairs enhances the feeling of \"wrong gravity\" even more as you wobble from left to right when spiraling around the Tower from the ground to the top of the 6th floor. It is definitely worth the time and the 18 EUR of the entrance ticket (see image below). Are there any regulations for visiting the Tower? You can visit the tower without a Guide. Entrance is scheduled in batches, every 15 minutes.Tickets must be purchased at the Ticket Office closeby the Tower. In alternative, you can get your ticket online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If you get the ticket on-site, you can expect a waiting time of 1-2 hours... therefore it is recommended to buy the ticket online. Make sure you show up at the entrance by the time shown on your ticket cause the tickets are valid only for the time printed on them and they are NOT refundable!

Lienhard Click here for audio of Episode 376. Today, we visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Medieval architects outreached themselves. The Gothic buildings that stand are a remarkable legacy. But we don't see the failures. Well, that isn't entirely so. We see a few. In fact one failure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is a marvel to see. The Leaning Tower, like many other old Tuscan towers, sits on soft soil. It's only one of many that've gone askew in various ways. But none is more dramatic. Its height, after 800 years of tilting and sinking into the soil, is about 184 feet. I always thought of the Tower as a Renaissance building, but it's older than that. Its construction began way back in 1173. When builders finished the first third, they found it'd tipped 0.2 degrees to the northwest. So they put it on hold for a century. By then the tilt had extended to 0.7 degrees. Yet the city fathers resumed construction anyway. Masons squared off the top of the tilted stump and built upward. The Tower tilted again, this time to the north. They stopped again. For another century the Tower sank and tilted — to the north, to the east, and finally to the south. With the Tower now leaning almost 2 degrees to the south, work went ahead once more in 1373. Masons squared off the top a second time and finished the Tower. Now the top was straight, but the lower portion had a gentle but permanent corkscrew shape. The Tower has continued tilting at an average rate of 21 seconds each year. Now it moves only 7 seconds per year, but that's cold comfort when it leans almost 5½ degrees off vertical — nearly a 10% tilt. And so it stands, majestic and eerie -- defying the rules of fall that Galileo was supposed to have learned on its summit. Walk with me to the top. The stair coils about the outside. You cringe against the wall each time you negotiate the south face and hang over empty space. You reach the summit, short of wind, and gaze out over the ancient intellectual center of Pisa. But there's one more tight circular staircase. Take a deep breath and mount it. Now you gaze down, even on the bells. Nothing more separates you from the blue Tuscan sky. And all the time you wonder what medieval magic keeps the Tower from abruptly finishing its fall while you stand there. Civil engineers have learned what its medieval builders did not know about foundations, but they haven't learned to end the Tower's movement. With an animal obstinacy, it curbs experiments. It responds to each measure by tilting faster. It teases our minds with its crazy, slow-motion, corkscrew fall. I'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work. (Theme music) Kerisel, J., A Few Hidden Errors in Medieval Architecture. Down to Earth.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day.

The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

Its construction was an ambitious project to create a 358-metre (1,175 ft)-high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the \"Great Tower of London\", it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park's emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium. Contents 1 Names 2 History 2.1 Design and construction 2.2 Opening and demolition 3 Legacy 4 References 5 External links Names[edit] Numerous names and nicknames were given to the tower during its planning, construction and legacy. These include Watkin's Tower,[2] Watkin's Folly,[3] the Wembley Park Tower,[4] the Wembley Tower,[1] the Metropolitan Tower,[4] and the London Stump.[5] History[edit] A caricature of Watkin by \"Ape\", published in Vanity Fair in 1875. Sir Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur, noted for being chairman of nine different British railway companies. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line, which was designed to accommodate the larger continental European trains which would cross into Britain from France. Although the channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.[6] Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park) in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin's amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.[6][7] The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893-4.[8] Design and construction[edit] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The winning design of Watkin's Tower (proposal n°37), later scrapped and replaced by a four-legged designThe final four-legged design of Watkin's Tower (shown with the Eiffel Tower for comparison purposes) Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people \"would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.\"[5] An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Tower of Pisa; a structure with \"a captive parachute to hold four persons\"; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a \"colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens\".[5] The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged 1,200-foot (366 m) metal tower – 45.8 metres (150 ft) taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was 312.2 metres (1,024 ft) at the time.[9][10] It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Turkish baths[3] and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.[6][11] Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.[1][7] Opening and demolition[edit] The first and only completed stage of Watkin's Wembley Tower (c.1900) Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 metres (154 ft) high.[7] At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower's legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.[1][4] Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the \"unsafe\" site was closed to the public the following year.[3] The completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite in 1904 to 1907.[3][12] Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin's star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to house building and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.[7] After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin's Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923, and later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.[5] A comparative diagram of Watkin's Tower with the Eiffel tower and London buildings Legacy[edit] Blackpool Tower (erected 1894) Wembley Park station, originally opened to bring visitors to Watkin's Tower Watkin's Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing. Although Watkin's tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines. A large Irish pub and restaurant in the area is called Watkin's Folly. The story of Watkin's Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, Metro-land. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin's vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London: “ Beyond Neasden there was an unimportant hamlet where for years the Metropolitan didn't stop. Wembley. Slushy fields and grass farms. Then out of the mist arose Sir Edward Watkin's dream: an Eiffel Tower for London. ” — Sir John Betjeman, Metro-Land The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for Metro-land can be found in Betjeman's England, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.[13] References[edit] Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-7195-3857-2 ^ a b c d Spencer, Adam (1995).

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

To be honest, I’m just not really sure what all the fuss is about. It’s just one of the hundreds of towers found throughout Italy, except this one happens to be leaning. In fact, this is not the only leaning tower in Italy! I distinctly recall seeing one in Venice and another on the island of Burano. A little research tells me that there are actually seven leaning towers in Italy, and three of them are located in Venice. So take that Pisa. Would I incorporate Pisa into a planned itinerary? No! If I am in the vicinity would I make an effort to see it? Absolutely! So the obvious question is should you make the time to get to Pisa to see this famous Italian landmark, and is it worth the effort? The answer really depends on where you are coming from and how much time, energy, and money you are willing to spend to see it. To be honest, there are plenty of other interesting sites to see across Italy, so dedicating half a day to a full day just to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa means less time spent elsewhere. On the flip side, we are all tourists at heart, and certainly, there is something about this tower that lures visitors from all over the world, so why not see it? I will tell you that I have actually been to Pisa twice to see the tower. Neither visit was really planned, but because we were close by, it was easy to get to and we figured we might as well see it. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134478_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Piazza die Miracoli\" title=\"Piazza die Miracoli\"/>Piazza die Miracoli | Source What Is There to See Besides the Tower?The entire tower complex is known as the Piazza die Miracoli, or the Field of Miracles. Four buildings make up the complex, including the Bell Tower (Campanile), the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the cloister that encloses part of the cemetery. The Cathedral of Pisa—one of Italy’s Grand Cathedrals—is a magnificent building that was started in 1063 and completed in 1092, almost 80 years before construction began on the tower. The entire complex is contained within a walled area and is very compact with everything within close proximity to each other. If you venture outside of the complex in search of interesting sites, I’m afraid there is not a great deal to see, at least in my opinion. There is the Botanical Garden, the Piazza del Cavalieri, and a scenic path along the Arno River, but most visitors seem interested in seeing just the tower. I've been to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower, and it's leaning.

It is certainly one of Italy’s most popular attractions, and it draws visitors from all over the world. It’s actually a lot of fun to people watch the crowds in the complex as they try to get their photos and selfies. Like it or not, this tower is a part of Italy’s legacy, and the community of Pisa has gone to great lengths to preserve the tower and make sure that it is safe for visitors to view and climb. Interesting Tower FactsConstruction started in 1173 and finished in 1399. The tower was originally planned to be 60 meters tall. Its height today is 56.67 meters on the high side and 55.86 meters on the low side. Surprisingly, there is confusion and controversy over the number of steps to the top. Various websites range from 250 to 297, which seems like a large margin of error. According to a website I found where they actually counted the steps while filming the ascent, there are 269 steps to the top of the tower. I believe this number is correct. The tower has eight stories, which includes the top floor bell chamber. There are seven bells in the tower, one for each note on the musical major scale. The tower is leaning due to the soft and unstable clay soil upon which it was built, and an inadequate foundation. By 1178, as construction reached the third story, the tower had already begun to lean. A renovation project to secure the tower was completed in 2001. This project made the tower safe for visitors to climb. The engineers that worked on the tower renovation project believe that it is possible to totally straighten it. However, nobody really wants that to happen, especially the community of Pisa that has lived off of the six million annual visitors to the tower for a very long time. Prior to the restoration project, the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees, it now leans at an angle of about 3.99 degrees. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134484_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Cathedral of Pisa\" title=\"Cathedral of Pisa\"/>Cathedral of Pisa | Source Visitor InformationHours:​​ April to Sept: 9 am to 8 pm, except open until 10 pm mid-June through Aug. ​​October: 9 am to 7 pm. ​​November: 9 am to 6 pm. ​​December to February: 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. ​​March: 9 am to 6 pm, 7 pm the last week of the month.

It is accessible by train from Lucca, Florence, and Rome. The trip from Lucca is just 30 minutes, while Florence is about an hour away. How Much Time Should You Spend in Pisa? Expect to spend a few hours to visit the entire tower complex and to take your photos. If you are coming from Lucca or Florence you can definitely do this in half a day and be back in time to enjoy other sites. Rome, while further away, is still doable and will take approximately two and a half hours by train. Should you be arriving by car, there is plenty of parking surrounding the complex. Some of it is free and some requires a fee. If you are arriving by train at the Pisa Central Station, be aware that the tower complex is 2 kilometers away, about a 25-minute walk or a 10-euro taxi ride. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134340_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"2448\" data-height=\"3264\" alt=\"Even I got in on the fun.\" title=\"Even I got in on the fun.\"/>Even I got in on the fun. | Source Our First VisitI mentioned earlier that we have seen the Leaning Tower of Pisa twice. The first time we were staying in a small village called Montemagno. It’s in the hills outside of Pisa and my very first glimpse of the tower was from our B&B window using a long telephoto lens. It was great fun to spot it from about seven miles away, albeit was small and distant. We did get into Pisa on that trip and what I took from that visit was that it is definitely over-hyped, yet a lot of fun to actually see it and create funny photos doing stupid things in front of the tower. This is of course why so many people want to see it, so they can take that coveted selfie or photo struggling to right the tower before it collapses. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134494_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\" title=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\"/>It’a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture. | Source Our Second VisitOur second visit to Pisa was much more recent, and this time we came from Lucca. Pisa is, in fact, a very easy day-trip from Lucca for those who want to get there, see it, and get out of there. Lucca, by the way, is absolutely beautiful and has lots of towers that are higher and just as interesting, in case you were interested. Lucca is a mere 12 miles north of Pisa and a very easy 30-minute train ride away. If your travels are taking you to Lucca, definitely consider taking a few hours to visit Pisa. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14139410_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source <img src=\"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14134479_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source So why did we return to see the tower a second time? We were traveling with friends who had not seen it, and being so close, you can hardly ignore its drawing power. The entire complex, which is contained within a high wall to hide its treasures, can be accessed through a couple of gates. The price you will pay to enter, which is free, is a run through the gauntlet of vendors trying to sell you Pisa trinkets and souvenirs. It’s actually an unwelcome and somewhat tacky introduction to the complex. Once you manage to slither through, however, I think you will be impressed, as I was, at the beautiful green grass that carpets the complex and the stunning cathedral before you. And yes, located just behind the cathedral is the tower that leans, the reason you are here.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below.

We’ll look at how structures connect to the ground and transmit loads through their foundations, and how those foundations need to provide a high bearing capacity. We’ll see how properties of the soil, like shear strength, affect bearing capacity. We’ll also consider happens when the ground experiences stress from seismic activity and how seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.Crash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Subscribe to Hot Mess: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaE...***RESOURCES:https://www.thebalancesmb.com/leaning...http://environment.uwe.ac.uk/geocal/f...http://www.geotechnicalinfo.com/beari...http://civil.utm.my/azril/files/2016/...http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~cnan/Princi...https://icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/in...https://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schoo...https://www.ramjack.com/houston/about...https://leaningtowerpisa.com/facts/ho...***Crash Course is on Patreon!

Just one little miscalculation made in the 11th century left us with an amazing 14,500 ton leaning tower! Known among Italians as Torre Pendente di Pisa, this piece of architecture is significally different from most medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is located on the city’s main square, Piazza del Duomo. This square is also known as Piazza dei Miracoli, “Miracles’ Square”, a name given by Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 1987 the whole square became one of the many Italian UNESCO World Heritage sites! The leaning tower is the third oldest building built in the square, after the wonderful Cathedral and its Baptistry. With its many columns and archs, this tower boasts an advanced knowledge of weight and load characteristics, showing the Italian architectures’ expertise. Why is the tower leaning then? What the architect didn’t account for was the base of the tower, which was built on a dense section of clay… The Early Years of the Leaning Tower of Pisa The construction of the Tower began in 1173. Originally designed to be a bell tower, it stood upright for over 5 years, but when the third floorwas completed in 1178 it began to lean. Italians were shocked by the event, as the tower began to lean ever so slightly. The thing is the foundation of the tower, which is only 3-meter deep, was built on a dense clay mixture. This mix impacted the soil and furthermore the clay was not strong enough to hold the tower upright. As a result the weight of the tower began to diffuse downward until it had found the weakest point. Due to this problem, construction works stopped for 100 years. The government decided to focus on its war with Genoa and hope that the soil would settle in the meantime. Mistake after mistake! After 100 years, engineer Giovanni di Simone stepped forward and started to add more floors to the tower. He tried to compensate for the original lean by making one side of the upper floors taller than the other. This only caused the tower to lean over even more… Unconcerned by the leaning, the tower was added a 7th floor in the second part of the 14th century, as well as a bell tower, and then the tower was left on its own until the 19th century. In 1838 architect Alessandro Della Gherardesca, dug a pathway at the base of the tower to allow people to admire the intricately crafted base. This caused the tower to lean even more, probably due to the digging of its base. Tower survives World War II World War II caused destruction all over the World. The leaning tower of Pisa, however, was very very lucky. In fact when American soldiers invaded Pisa, they were ordered to destroy all buildings as to prevent enemy snipers to find suitable places to hide. There were no exceptions to this rule, and many buildings were blown up everyday, as the US forces advanced over the Italian countryside. However a retreat took place shortly after the arrival of the Americans, making unnecessary to destroy the Leaning Tower of Pisa! And it is still standing! Twenty years after the end of the war Italy asked help to avoid the Leaning Tower from toppling. They didn’t want the tower to lose its leaning though, because it is now the symbol of the city, a landmark loved by tourists from all over the world. As a temporary measure engineers and architects installed a leaden counterweight of 800 tonnes. In 1987 the Leaning Tower of Pisa was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, together with the entire Piazza Del Duomo, but in 1990 it was closed. Its bells were removed and the tower was anchored, only to reopen in 2001.Tourists now can safely visit the leaning tower of Pisa!

Like its name suggest, it actually does lean to one side. The tower started to lean during construction because the foundation was built on soft ground that had difficulty supporting the weight. The lean became worse as construction continued for several decades. Between 1990 and 2001 it was stabilized and the lean was partially fixed. Interesting Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts: In Italian the Leaning Tower of Pisa is Torre pendente di Pisa. It was built as a freestanding bell tower for the cathedral in Pisa. On the side where the tower is lower because of the lean it stands at 187.27 feet. On the high side of the tower it stands at 186 feet. The tower weighs about 14,500 tons. That's a lot of weight for a building to have to support when it has been leaning since it was built. There are approximately 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side of the tower. The Leaning Tower of Pisa took 344 years to build, beginning in August 1173. It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground. The construction was stopped twice, the first time for 100 years, the second time in 1284. Both times it was due to wars. If it hadn't been for the two pauses in construction it would have taken between 185 and 195 years to complete. Inside the tower there are seven bells. Each bell represents one note of the musical major scale. The first stones used to form the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa were purchased with the money left to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie by Donna Berta di Bernardo in 1172. Nobody seems to be able to pinpoint the identity of who the actual original architect really was. During World War II, the Allies heard that Germans were using the Leaning Tower of Pisa as an observation post. Once the Allies saw how beautiful the tower was they refrained from destroying it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Also included in this designation were the cathedral, cemetery and the baptistery. In 1989 another tower called the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed. This sped up the restoration efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower was closed to the public from 1989 until 2001, after the restoration was complete. It is thought that the restoration will keep the Leaning Tower of Pisa stable for at 300 years more. In 2008 engineers stated that the Tower had stopped moving. This is the first time in its history that it has not been slowly leaning further to one side. If the construction of the tower had not been halted the first time due to war it would have toppled over. The hundred years it had to sit helped to let it settle (compact). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a circular shape and has eight floors. The 7 bells are located on the eighth floor. Some people have suggested that the tower should be straightened. The people have Pisa had said they would rather see it fall over than be straightened. After all, how could you call it the Leaning Tower of Pisa if it didn't lean? medianet_width = \"600\"; medianet_height = \"280\"; medianet_crid = \"426465885\"; medianet_versionId = \"3111299\"; Related Links: Facts Wonders of the World Facts Animals Facts (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <a href=\"http://www.softschools.com/facts/wonders_of_the_world/leaning_tower_of_pisa_facts/93/\">Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts</a> var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\"); document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\")); var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-286169-1\"); pageTracker._initData(); pageTracker._trackPageview(); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-2\"); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-3'); }); More Topics Handwriting Spanish Facts Examples Formulas Difference Between Inventions Literature Flashcards 2019 Calendar Online Calculators Multiplication Educational Videos"}],"keywords":["description"]},{"url":"https://www.livitaly.com/leaning-tower-of-pisa-history/","title":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours","sections":[{"title":"main","content":"Italy Travel Blog The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours April 18, 2018 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures in Italy & the world, so it’s little surprise that it draws in over 1 million visitors each year to see and take photos with the amazing monument. It has been depicted in numerous books, movies, and cartoons, so it’s little surprise that there are so many stories and tales about the tower. This stunning structure stands (or leans) in the city of Pisa, which is a short ride from Florence, the capital city of central Italy’s Tuscany region. The tower is the third oldest structure in the city’s Piazza del Duomo, or “Cathedral Square” in English. Most people are familiar with the tower from seeing photographs of their friends and family posing next to them (don’t worry we have all done it) but many don’t know much more about the intriguing history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Leaning Tower of Pisa History As the city of Pisa grew as an important Italian seaport, its people wanted to emphasize its significance with a cathedral complex. This so-called “Field of Miracles” included a baptistery, a cathedral & of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was then built to serve as the bell tower. Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1137, but it was not completed until the mid-14th century due to war, debt, and other interruptions which stalled its construction. Trying to find out the exact history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a little bit more complex than you may think. The design of the tower has historically been attributed to the 12th century Italian artist Bonanno Pisano, who was most well-known for his bronze castings. While his name was found in a shard of cast at the foot of the tower in the early 19th century, some historians argue that this is not evidence of his contribution and that the cast may instead be related to the cathedral that was destroyed in the late 16th century. In more recent times, some researchers have suggested that Diotisalvi might have been the original architect, because he designed the Baptistery and the bell tower of San Nicola in Pisa, and all of these works show some resemblance to each other. Guglielmo has been said to have lain the foundations of the tower, and a builder named Gerardo di Gerardo has also been credited with the early phases of construction. Giovani di Simone was involved in the second phase and Tommaso Pisano in the final phase.

So obviously everyone knows the tower because it leans – but the tower was not purposefully designed to lean. Due to the soft ground that the tower was built on and shifting soil upon which it was built, it served to destabilize the foundation. The tower had begun to lean by the time its builders reached the third story. Over time, it began to fall about two millimeters per year, until it was leaning at an angle of 5.5 degrees. Restoration work has taken place in the late 20th century to make sure that the tower doesn’t fall over, however, the leaning tower of Pisa now leans a little less than 4 degrees. It is now thought that the tower will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries but in fact, it may never fall. In the wake of this careful restoration project and the attraction’s re-opening, there has never been a better time to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa! How Was the Leaning Tower of Pisa Used? In legend, Galileo used the tower to prove that the speed of a falling object is independent of its mass. He supposedly dropped different weights of cannonballs from the top of the tower. The Germans were also suspected to have used the tower for observation during the Second World War. Eventually it became a major tourist attraction, full of people attempting to take the perfect photo. The Leaning Tower was closed to the public from 1990-2001 for stabilization, but it has since been reopened. The tower was on the brink of collapse not long ago. However, because of the restoration project conducted in the 1990s, which called upon the expertise of mathematicians, scientists, architects, and other talents, it is now thought that the Tower of Pisa will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries. In fact, it may never fall. Kathleen Bello I am so grateful to find your particular post.

As a vital seaport and a major center of trade, many people visited the city. In the early days, Pisa was a popular resting place for pilgrims from Europe on their way to Jerusalem. The military fleet of Pisa was most successful. In 871 the fleet helped defend the Salerno from attackers, and it was Pisans that forced the Arab troops from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia in 1015. The city of Pisa, Italy As their riches and influence increased, the city of Pisa, Italy, became more and more powerful. The island of Corsica came under Pisan control in 1077, and in 1113 so did the Balearic Islands near Spain. The Pisans enjoyed a time of great prosperity The decline of Pisa began in 1284 when Genoa defeated the Pisans in battle. The islands controlled by Pisa were lost and the influence began to decline. By the 15th century the Arno River had become so filled with silt that it completely cut off Pisa from the sea. This marked the end of Pisa as a useful port and the end of its wealth and power. Pisa Tower Construction In 1174, engineer Bonnano Pisano laid a marble foundation large enough to park about 16 Ferrari 328s in and started building the campanile for the cathedral and baptistry of Pisa. The Romanesque Tower of Pisa, comprising 14,000 tonnes of white marble, was completed 176 years later – but it was also embarrassingly crooked. Because there was a lot of water under the ground in this area, Bonnano was able to place the foundation only about 10 feet down into the ground. As the first story of the tower was completed, the south side began to sink. The builders tried to make it look better by building the columns and arches on the south side about an inch taller than those on the north side. However by the time they got to the fourth story, they had to make the southern columns 2 inches taller than the northern ones. The tower just continued to lean, and because of the difficulties the construction was stopped. Pisa Tower Architecture In 1234, the architect Benenato discovered that the tower was leaning even more. Now the south side of the fourth story was a full 6 inches shorter than the north side. He added a fifth story, again making the south columns taller than the north ones. After adding that one story, Benenato gave up, and again construction on the tower stopped. Almost thirty years later, in 1260, William of Innsbruck added the sixth and seventh stories to the Tower of Pisa. In 1350 Tommaso Pisano started work on the eighth story of the tower, the bell chamber. He found that the tower was still sinking, and so he made the spiral stairs inside the tower and the wall of the bell chamber higher on the south side than on the north. The tower was finally completed in 1372, almost 200 years after it was begun, and it was still leaning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

2018Original:Dec 3, 2015Why does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean?Author:Sarah PruittPick any day in the Piazza del Duomo in the Italian city of Pisa, and you will undoubtedly spot a bunch of tourists posing for the same photo: hands outstretched towards the cathedral’s conspicuously tilting bell tower, as if they are supporting it with their sheer strength. The so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world, although maybe not for the reasons its original architects would have wanted. In 1173, construction began on a white marble bell tower for the cathedral complex in Pisa, located between the Arno and Serchio rivers in Tuscany, central Italy. By the time builders had finished the third of eight planned stories about five years later, the tower’s foundation had begun to settle unevenly on the ground beneath it, a dense mixture of clay, sand and shells. As a result, the structure had begun to tilt visibly toward the south. Shortly after that, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, another Italian city-state, halting construction for nearly a century. This delay allowed the foundation to settle further, likely prevented the bell tower’s premature collapse. When construction resumed, chief engineer Giovanni di Simone tried to compensate for the lean by adding extra masonry to the short side, but the additional weight caused the structure to tilt even further. The tower was officially completed around 1370, but its lean only increased over the next six centuries, becoming an integral part of the monument’s quirky appeal. Despite various attempts to reinforce it, Pisa’s tower continued to subside at a rate of some 0.05 inches per year, placing it in increasing danger of collapse. By 1990, it was leaning 5.5 degrees (or some 15 feet) from the perpendicular–the most extreme angle yet. That year, the monument was closed to visitors and the bells removed as engineers started extensive reparations to stabilize it. By siphoning earth from beneath and adding counterweights to the tower’s north end, they were able to reduce the lean to 13.5 feet, or 4.0 degrees from perpendicular. The straightening continued after the tower reopened in 2001, and in 2008 sensors showed the subsiding motion had stopped, after a total improvement of some 19 inches. Engineers now believe the Leaning Tower of Pisa will remain stable for some 200 years, barring an earthquake or other unpredictable disaster.Tagsterms:ItalyEngineeringBy Sarah PruittFACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

(Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) In 1990 an international team of engineers, mathematicians, and historians met on the Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Their task was to figure out how to save an 800-year-old historic building that was close to collapsing. The structure was then tilted by 5.5 degrees to one side. If something wasn't done soon, the world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa would come crashing to the ground. The structure was originally meant to simply be a free standing bell tower (or campanile) for the city of Pisa's cathedral. Such towers were commonly built in 10th century Italy to symbolize the town's power and economic wealth. Historians aren't sure who the structure's original architect might be. For many years it was thought to be Bonanno Pisano, a Pisa resident and artisan noted for creating a number of ornate bronze doors for cathedrals. However, scholars now suspect that Diotisalvi, who was the architect of Pisa's San Nicola bell tower and the city's baptistery, might actually be responsible. Seven Quick Facts Height: 183 feet, 3 inches (55.8m) Angle of tilt: 3.97 degrees - 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) off vertical Steps to top: 296 Construction: Started 1173, finished 1372 Function: Bell Tower for the Cathedral at Pisa, Italy Built of: Masonry and Marble Other: Contains 7 bells tuned to the major musical scale In either case we know that construction on the tower started in 1173 AD near the city's cathedral on a piece of land known as Piazza dei Miracoli (\"Square of Miracles\"). The tower was round and 52 feet (16m) in diameter at the base with a projected height of 191 feet (58m). The first level was to be taller than the rest and have an elaborate entry portal decorated with sculptures of monsters and animals. The second story would have open marble arcades with many columns. On top of that there would be five more levels with facades similar to the second story. Finally, the roof would be capped with a bell chamber designed to contain 7 bells. Imperfect from the Beginning By the time the third floor was finished in 1178, it was clear that the tower was leaning slightly to the northwest. The problem was that the foundation was only 10 feet (3m) deep and the soil underneath was soft and unstable. The citizens of Pisa decided to stop construction for a while and let the tower settle a bit with the hope that it would straighten itself out, or at least stop moving. In any case, several wars with neighboring towns required their attention. The tower now leans 3.97 degrees off of true.(Photo by Softeis.

In 1272, under the direction of Giovanni di Simone, construction resumed. To try and compensate for the tilt, he designed the upper stories so that they had one side slightly taller than the other. By the time the 7th floor was completed, it became apparent that the building was moving again and the lean increasing, this time to the south. In 1284 work was halted again due to another war. Finally, the bell tower was finished in 1372. Over the next few centuries the 7 bells would be installed in the bell chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale. The tower continued to move and by the 16th century it was a full 3 degrees off vertical. Pisa's campanile, however, wasn't the only European tower that was crooked. Over the years many of these collapsed or were replaced with newer structures. Pisa's tilted bell tower, however, survived and eventually became a major landmark not despite its lean, but because of it. In 1911 engineers began careful measurements of the tower's angle and realized that it was still moving at the rate of a 1/20 of an inch per year. In 1934 engineers working for the dictator Benito Mussolini - who found the tilt an offense to his Fascist ideals - attempted to correct the problem by injecting 200 tons of concrete under the foundation. This, however, just made the problem worse. By 1989 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees and its top was out of plumb by 17 feet (5m). Its predicament was underscored when a similar bell tower in the town of Pavia unexpectedly collapsed. Officials decided to close the Pisa's tower to visitors, evacuate the area under it and put together an international team to figure out how to save it. Fixing the Tower One of the seven bells housed in the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018)) Team member John Burland, a soil mechanics specialist from Imperial College London, wondered if removing soil from under the tower's northern foundation might help correct the tilt. After running a number of computer simulations, the team decided that such a strategy was their best bet. To keep the building from coming apart while they worked on it, a number of temporary measures were put in place. First, steel bands were wrapped around the first floor to support the masonry there. Then, 827 tons of lead weights were placed on the northern side of the building to act as a counter-balance. A concrete ring was also placed around the building at the third level connected to heavy steel cables anchored in the ground to keep the structure from any further southern movement. Finally the massive bells were removed to decrease the total weight of the building. With these measures in place, the team drilled a hole at an angle under the northern side of the tower to remove some earth. Over a number of years they repeated this procedure while measuring what it did to the tilt of the tower. A total of 41 holes were made removing 77 tons of soil causing the tower to move backwards toward a more stable position. By 2001 the tower had moved back to the same lean it had in the 1930's and officials decided it was safe to reopen the structure to visitors. The intention was never to straighten the tower completely. It still leans 3.97 degrees out of true with the top being 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) from vertical. The cables and other temporary measures have been removed. Engineers believe they have stabilized the tilt so that the tower should be safe for at least several hundred years, barring a major incident like an earthquake. Looking up at the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) That's a relief to the citizens of Pisa for whom the well-loved, but off-kilter tower is a world recognized icon for their town and a source of tourist dollars. The structure isn't only known for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. Galileo Galilei, the astronomer, is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball from the tower to prove that weight does not affect how fast an object falls. While his conjecture indeed proved true, historians have called into question whether he actually did his test from the top of the tower at Pisa. Even so, the tower remains strongly associated in people's minds with the great scientist. Why Does it Stand At All? One of the mysteries of the tower is not just why it leans, but why it continues to stand at all. The area around Pisa is subject to earthquakes and the tower has lived through at least four major quakes during its life, yet even as off-kilter as it is, it still stands. In 2018 a study led by Roma Tre University's Professor Camillo Nuti suggests that the reason it leans is the exact same reason it still stands. \"Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Pisa tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\" noted Professor George Mylonakis, from the University of Bristol, UK, who was a member of the team that worked on the study. According to the report the softness of the soil, combined with the stiffness of the tower, prevents it from resonating, or vibrating along, with the earthquake's ground motion and protects the structure from damage. In 1987 the tower, along with the associated cathedral, baptistery and cemetery, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower has also been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. Ironically, while the preservation efforts have saved the tower, they have also caused it to lose the title of the most crooked structure in the world, This distinction now goes to the leaning tower of Suurhusen, in Germany, which is 5.3 degrees out of true.

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

(c) 2006, SCALA, Florence / ART RESOURCE, N.Y., artres.com, scalarchives.com The tilt was even more pronounced before modern efforts at stabilization began, and by some accounts has reached 8-10 degrees in past centuries. But while stabilizing the tower has been important to its physical preservation, it may have negatively affected the church’s historical legacy. Since the Leaning Tower of Pisa was straightened out, several other buildings–mainly in Germany and Switzerland–have been vying for the slanted spotlight, as was humorously reported by the New York Times in 2012. However, no attempt at dethroning Pisa as home to the farthest leaning building has been as bold as that of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. Starting in 2007, the city began work on the Capital Gate, which rises at an 18-degree westward lean–more than four times that of the Leaning Tower of Pisa–along the city’s waterfront. The topography and skyline of Abu Dhabi and of other major cities on the Persian Gulf have been rapidly changing in the past decade, with projects for major museums and cultural centers, shopping malls, offices, and condominiums underway or already completed. In Abu Dhabi alone, two outposts of renowned art museums are in the works – a branch of the Louvre, and a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi designed, respectively, by the famed architects Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. RMJM Architects, Capital Gate; overview of the building from nearby mosque exterior, 2010, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Even amid this development, though, the Capital Gate (opened in 2011) remains a unique structure for its arresting form, and the engineering feats that allowed for it. The architectural firm behind the building, RMJM Architects, devised a complex system to ensure that the Capital Gate stays at its intended lean. The building was the first to use what is known as a ‘pre-cambered’ core. 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel were sculpted in the opposite direction of the building’s incline and placed slightly off-center at its base. As the building rose, this core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position to support the mammoth structure. Other design elements employed to reinforce the Capital Gate’s unique shape include a steel exoskeleton, supported by 490 piles drilled 100 feet underground. The interior of the building matches the exterior in opulence. The Capital Gate houses an exhibition center, 20,000 square meters of luxury office space, and a five-star Hyatt hotel. Guests lucky enough to stay in one of the Hyatt’s rooms are greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows displaying a panoramic view of the city through custom-built window paneling. A large, airy atrium fills the central 17th and 18th floors, and contains both a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge. The 18th floor is also where the ‘Splash’–a 320-meter metal element that sweeps down from the outside of the building and connects to the nearby Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre–is placed. More than a mere aesthetic flourish, the Splash turns into a canopy for the Centre’s outdoor grandstand, used for viewing parades and other national events. Unsurprisingly, the client behind both buildings is one in the same: the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC), a national body that oversees conferences and exhibitions.

The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair; the Unisphere in New York City is a relic of the 1964/5 event; and in 2010 the city of Shanghai completed the Expo Axis, featuring one of the world’s largest membrane roofs, to accommodate the 2010 year’s World Exposition. The Capital Gate’s metallic, undulating shape lends it–and in turn the events it hosts–a cutting-edge appearance at a time when this region is staking its claim as a future international center for business and culture. Despite its bid for dominance in the architectural monuments game, though, Pisa may still have Abu Dhabi beat. The Capital Gate was given the honor of the Guinness World Record for “farthest leaning man-made structure,” but unless something goes awry with its foundation (and let’s hope it doesn’t), Pisa still houses, arguably, the world’s quirkiest and most iconic slanted structure – tilted by human error, not meticulous design plans. – Hannah Stamler You may also be interested in: Contemporary Architecture in the United Arab Emirates Posted in Features Related Posts August 26, 2019 Browsing Artstor just got easier!

Learn more Home News When Will the Leaning Tower of Pisa Fall Over? By Live Science Staff 2011-07-05T20:50:58Z Human Nature Shares Photograph of the Leaning Tower of Pisa taken circa 1890-1900. (Image: © Library of Congress) Experts say the famous tower at Pisa will lean for at least another 200 years. It may even stay upright well, almost upright forever. That's all thanks to a restoration project, which brought the tower back from the brink of collapse a decade ago.From the first moment of its construction on unstable subsurface soils in 1173, Pisa's bell tower tilted farther and farther to the south. Its early-onset lean even influenced the way it was built, as its architects tried to compensate by angling the structure northward, resulting in its being banana-shaped.A few ill-advised construction projects accelerated the Leaning Tower's invisibly slow fall during the past couple of centuries; it tilted 5.5 degrees, its acutest angle ever, in 1990. By all calculations, the tower should have toppled at just 5.44 degrees, but fortunately it defied the predictions of computer models just long enough for engineers to come up with a fix.Restoration work undertaken from 1999 to 2001 stabilized the tower. Engineers placed weights on the structure's north end, while at the same time extracting soil from below, causing it to slowly sink back in that direction.The Leaning Tower of Pisa still leans south, but now it does so at just 3.99 degrees. Barring a large earthquake or other unforeseen catastrophe, engineers believe it will stay put for at least a few hundred years.How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean?Why Are Construction Cranes So Dangerous?Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries, then join us on Facebook. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; var taboola_lists = []; function taboola_is_device(device) { if ((! device) || device === null || (typeof device) === 'undefined') return true if (device === 'amp') return false if (device === 'desktop' && window.screen.width >= 700) return true if (device === 'mobile' && window.screen.width < 700) return true return false } if (taboola_is_device(\"desktop\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-f\", container: \"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"mobile\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-g\", container: \"taboola-mobile-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mobile Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"amp\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-a\", container: \"\", placement: \"below-main-column\", target_type: \"\" }); } for(var i = 0; i < taboola_lists.length; i++){ _taboola.push(taboola_lists[i]); } Sign Up for e-mail newsletters Get breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky particles and more!

Whereas the Leaning Tower of Pisa is known for its classical architecture and famous tilt, we’re known for our Award Winning Pizza, delicious Sandwiches and Burgers, and the Best Garlic Cheese Bread in town! When we moved to our current location in 1959, the Leaning Tower was one of only four places in town where pizza was available. The price was moderate, with a large pizza ranging from $1.25 to $3.50. Although prices have risen, our pizza remains the same. In a time where corners are cut in the name of “progress”, our recipe hasn’t changed since the day we opened. We still make our own sauce, dough, and sausage, use only the freshest vegetables, herbs and spices, and top our pizza with 100% real cheese. Most other pizza establishments can not claim this standard. Tradition and Quality – This is what the Leaning Tower is made of. It has been our pleasure to serve you for the last sixty years.

How do we know? ...we went there and counted ourselves! Believe it or not, no one is reporting this fact right… neither Wikipedia nor Google and not even the signs in “Piazza dei Miracoli” in Pisa, where the Tower stands... or for better use of words, leans.So we went there and we counted the steps one by one ON VIDEO! We had the feeling something was wrong with the steps count when we noticed that practically every web page on the topic reports a different number.Figures range from 250 to 300 and it is very hard to understand who shall be trusted. There are 5 flights of stairs in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of which is spiraling around the entire building! As far as we can tell, THIS is the only article on the entire Internet reporting the correct number of steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. How can we be so sure? ...tired of mismatching numbers, we went to Pisa and climbed the Tower to count the steps with our own eyes!The figure we got is totally different from anything published online to this date. Yes, we feel your pain... the fact that one cannot really trust information found on the Internet is mind-boggling. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The video of our descent is at the bottom of this article... there you can see how the inside of the Tower looks like and you can even count the steps for yourself! The Stairs in the Leaning Tower First off, there are FIVE different stairs to get to the top of the Tower.Some are just a few steps to access the various parts of the Tower (1st, 2nd, 5th) and two of them are full-size spiral staircases (3rd and 4th) to move between the floors. <ul><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/45c18c7b22454c99e10c91d4bf6e3281.jpeg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/19e09108119c31304b49050bf0dd93ce.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-4.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/0bc58cd05538afd1e09b9f0226093702.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/415b2482fc65c03643b19772ea00ae81.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/b4736076b2b55b2354abcadeedd61a9d.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li></ul> The first stairs bring from the street level to the base of the Tower, about 150cm lower (5 feet).Once there, you have to climb a few steps to enter the Tower through it’s - one and only - entrance door.Let’s call this stairs nr #2. As you enter the monument, it strikes you… this thing is leaning big time! Like the rest of the Tower, the floor of the entrance room is inclined and you can feel it under your feet. The feeling you get is much stronger than what your eyes perceive from the outside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The inside of the Tower is hollow. There is only one room with virtually no ceiling. As a matter of fact, the ceiling is about 49m high, on the top of the 7th floor (image on the left). It feels big… and it feels so leaning… On the left of the entrance door, there is the main staircase that leads to the top. It is a spiral staircase that wraps clockwise around the Tower. This is the 3rd staircase you find in the monument (image below). The staircase is pretty narrow and people going up must stop giving the way to those coming down. The stairs climb at regular steps and they are interrupted at each floor by small intermediate landings. At each landing, there is an opening on the outside. Openings are door-sized and they are closed with metal grates to prevent visitors accessing the columns area and walking along the tiny edge… that’d be VERY dangerous. The main staircase ends right at the bottom of the 7th floor. Once you are up, you can walk around the entire circumference of the Tower and admire the wonderful view. You are now walking outside, in the space between the wall of the Tower and the columns of the 7th floor. This space is about 1 meter wide (3 feet) and, like the openings of the floors below, it is protected by metal grates installed right before the columns. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Getting to the Top To get to the top of the 7th floor you have to climb on more flight of stairs (the 4th in the Tower). This last spiral staircase is really tiny and two persons can hardly exchange the way. These stairs land at the base of the bells chamber (8th floor). To enter the bells chamber you have a fifth set of steps to climb (just a few steps). You are now standing inside the bells chamber, on the bottom of the 8th floor.This is the highest point allowed to visitors. There is another flight of tiny stairs that climb up to the very top of the Tower but it is closed to the public since it leads on the tiny edge of the top of the bells chamber (8th floor). You might be surprised to find out that the floor of the 8th story is perfectly flat… well, no wonders, it took 200 years to figure out how to make that happen and they eventually got it right. When you are on the top of the 7th floor you are standing on the tallest building in Pisa. The view is unobstructed in every direction, except for the West, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of majestic Cathedral which very top is the same height as the Tower. The number of Steps It is time to do the math on the actual steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The first flight of stairs has 8 steps (from street level to the base of the Tower) The second flight has 4 steps (from the base to the inside) On the main staircase there are: 58 steps to reach the 2nd floor 31 steps to reach the 3rd floor 30 steps to reach the 4th floor 30 steps to reach the 5th floor 32 steps to reach the 6th floor 36 steps to reach the 7th floor The fourth flight of stairs to go from the 7th to the 8th floor also counts 36 steps. Finally, there are 4 steps on the short ramp to access the bell chamber (on the 8th floor). Summing up, there are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bells chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. The grand total is 269 steps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, this number is 24 steps shorter of what published in the signs in the Square of Miracles, right below the Tower (293), 25-27 steps less than what stated by Wikipedia and 15 steps less than what answered by Google in its Answer box at the moment of writing. Hopefully, Google and Wikipedia will soon acknowledge this mistake and refer to this post as the correct source of information when it comes to the question “how many steps are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa?”. There are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bell chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. How long does it take to climb the Tower? At this point, you might wonder how long it takes to climb the 257 steps inside the Tower and get a chance to see its seven bells... It took us about 20 minutes to climb up to the top of the monument, including the time for taking a few photos and dealing with the \"traffic\" inside the Tower. Getting down is about four times faster. The video below was shot on our way down and you can clearly see ALL the steps of the 4th and 3rd staircase... so you can crosscheck our numbers :) Is it worth climbing the Leaning Tower? Entering the Tower is the best way to experience its famous lean.Climbing the main stairs enhances the feeling of \"wrong gravity\" even more as you wobble from left to right when spiraling around the Tower from the ground to the top of the 6th floor. It is definitely worth the time and the 18 EUR of the entrance ticket (see image below). Are there any regulations for visiting the Tower? You can visit the tower without a Guide. Entrance is scheduled in batches, every 15 minutes.Tickets must be purchased at the Ticket Office closeby the Tower. In alternative, you can get your ticket online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If you get the ticket on-site, you can expect a waiting time of 1-2 hours... therefore it is recommended to buy the ticket online. Make sure you show up at the entrance by the time shown on your ticket cause the tickets are valid only for the time printed on them and they are NOT refundable! NOTE: backpacks and purses are NOT allowed in the Tower and you must leave them in the lockers at the Ticket Office. You can drop them 15 minutes before your scheduled visit and you'll be given a key-card for retrieving them after the tour. Do you want to know more? ...keep reading...

Lienhard Click here for audio of Episode 376. Today, we visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Medieval architects outreached themselves. The Gothic buildings that stand are a remarkable legacy. But we don't see the failures. Well, that isn't entirely so. We see a few. In fact one failure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is a marvel to see. The Leaning Tower, like many other old Tuscan towers, sits on soft soil. It's only one of many that've gone askew in various ways. But none is more dramatic. Its height, after 800 years of tilting and sinking into the soil, is about 184 feet. I always thought of the Tower as a Renaissance building, but it's older than that. Its construction began way back in 1173. When builders finished the first third, they found it'd tipped 0.2 degrees to the northwest. So they put it on hold for a century. By then the tilt had extended to 0.7 degrees. Yet the city fathers resumed construction anyway. Masons squared off the top of the tilted stump and built upward. The Tower tilted again, this time to the north. They stopped again. For another century the Tower sank and tilted — to the north, to the east, and finally to the south. With the Tower now leaning almost 2 degrees to the south, work went ahead once more in 1373. Masons squared off the top a second time and finished the Tower. Now the top was straight, but the lower portion had a gentle but permanent corkscrew shape. The Tower has continued tilting at an average rate of 21 seconds each year. Now it moves only 7 seconds per year, but that's cold comfort when it leans almost 5½ degrees off vertical — nearly a 10% tilt. And so it stands, majestic and eerie -- defying the rules of fall that Galileo was supposed to have learned on its summit. Walk with me to the top. The stair coils about the outside. You cringe against the wall each time you negotiate the south face and hang over empty space. You reach the summit, short of wind, and gaze out over the ancient intellectual center of Pisa. But there's one more tight circular staircase. Take a deep breath and mount it. Now you gaze down, even on the bells. Nothing more separates you from the blue Tuscan sky. And all the time you wonder what medieval magic keeps the Tower from abruptly finishing its fall while you stand there. Civil engineers have learned what its medieval builders did not know about foundations, but they haven't learned to end the Tower's movement. With an animal obstinacy, it curbs experiments. It responds to each measure by tilting faster. It teases our minds with its crazy, slow-motion, corkscrew fall. I'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work. (Theme music) Kerisel, J., A Few Hidden Errors in Medieval Architecture. Down to Earth.

Extensive work was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees.Pisa, Leaning Tower ofLeaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.© CorbisClose-up of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.iStockphoto/ThinkstockLeaning Tower of Pisa (left) and the cathedral, Pisa, Italy.Photos.com/ThinkstockThe bell tower, begun in 1173 as the third and final structure of the city’s cathedral complex, was designed to stand 185 feet (56 metres) high and was constructed of white marble. Three of its eight stories had been completed when the uneven settling of the building’s foundations in the soft ground became noticeable. At that time, war broke out between the Italian city-states, and construction was halted for almost a century. This pause allowed the tower’s foundation to settle and likely prevented its early collapse.Pisa, Leaning Tower ofBell chamber at the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.© Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Giovanni di Simone, the engineer in charge when construction resumed, sought to compensate for the lean by making the new stories slightly taller on the short side, but the extra masonry caused the structure to sink still further. The project was plagued with interruptions, as engineers sought solutions to the leaning problem, but the tower was ultimately topped out in the 14th century. Twin spiral staircases lined the tower’s interior, with 294 steps leading from the ground to the bell chamber (one staircase incorporates two additional steps to compensate for the tower’s lean). Over the next four centuries the tower’s seven bells were installed; the largest weighed more than 3,600 kg (nearly 8,000 pounds). By the early 20th century, however, the heavier bells were silenced, as it was believed that their movement could potentially worsen the tower’s lean.The foundations have been strengthened by the injection of cement grout and various types of bracing and reinforcement, but in the late 20th century the structure was still subsiding, at the rate of 0.05 inch (1.2 mm) per year, and was in danger of collapse. In 1990 the tower was closed and all the bells silenced as engineers undertook a major straightening project. Earth was siphoned from underneath the foundations, decreasing the lean by 17 inches (44 cm) to 13.5 feet (4.1 metres); the work was completed in May 2001, and the structure was reopened to visitors. The tower continued to straighten without further excavation, until in May 2008 sensors showed that the motion had finally stopped, at a total improvement of 19 inches (48 cm). Engineers expected the tower to remain stable for at least 200 years. Get unlimited access to all of Britannica’s trusted content.

This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.

For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

Its construction was an ambitious project to create a 358-metre (1,175 ft)-high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the \"Great Tower of London\", it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park's emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium.

Sir Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur, noted for being chairman of nine different British railway companies. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line, which was designed to accommodate the larger continental European trains which would cross into Britain from France. Although the channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.[6] Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park) in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin's amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.[6][7] The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893-4.[8] Design and construction[edit] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The winning design of Watkin's Tower (proposal n°37), later scrapped and replaced by a four-legged designThe final four-legged design of Watkin's Tower (shown with the Eiffel Tower for comparison purposes) Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people \"would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.\"[5] An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Tower of Pisa; a structure with \"a captive parachute to hold four persons\"; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a \"colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens\".[5] The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged 1,200-foot (366 m) metal tower – 45.8 metres (150 ft) taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was 312.2 metres (1,024 ft) at the time.[9][10] It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Turkish baths[3] and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.[6][11] Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.[1][7] Opening and demolition[edit] The first and only completed stage of Watkin's Wembley Tower (c.1900) Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 metres (154 ft) high.[7] At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower's legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.[1][4] Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the \"unsafe\" site was closed to the public the following year.[3] The completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite in 1904 to 1907.[3][12] Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin's star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to house building and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.[7] After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin's Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923, and later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.[5] A comparative diagram of Watkin's Tower with the Eiffel tower and London buildings Legacy[edit] Blackpool Tower (erected 1894) Wembley Park station, originally opened to bring visitors to Watkin's Tower Watkin's Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing. Although Watkin's tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines. A large Irish pub and restaurant in the area is called Watkin's Folly. The story of Watkin's Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, Metro-land. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin's vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London: “ Beyond Neasden there was an unimportant hamlet where for years the Metropolitan didn't stop. Wembley. Slushy fields and grass farms. Then out of the mist arose Sir Edward Watkin's dream: an Eiffel Tower for London. ” — Sir John Betjeman, Metro-Land The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for Metro-land can be found in Betjeman's England, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.[13] References[edit] Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-7195-3857-2 ^ a b c d Spencer, Adam (1995).

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

To be honest, I’m just not really sure what all the fuss is about. It’s just one of the hundreds of towers found throughout Italy, except this one happens to be leaning. In fact, this is not the only leaning tower in Italy! I distinctly recall seeing one in Venice and another on the island of Burano. A little research tells me that there are actually seven leaning towers in Italy, and three of them are located in Venice. So take that Pisa. Would I incorporate Pisa into a planned itinerary? No! If I am in the vicinity would I make an effort to see it? Absolutely! So the obvious question is should you make the time to get to Pisa to see this famous Italian landmark, and is it worth the effort? The answer really depends on where you are coming from and how much time, energy, and money you are willing to spend to see it. To be honest, there are plenty of other interesting sites to see across Italy, so dedicating half a day to a full day just to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa means less time spent elsewhere. On the flip side, we are all tourists at heart, and certainly, there is something about this tower that lures visitors from all over the world, so why not see it? I will tell you that I have actually been to Pisa twice to see the tower. Neither visit was really planned, but because we were close by, it was easy to get to and we figured we might as well see it. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134478_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Piazza die Miracoli\" title=\"Piazza die Miracoli\"/>Piazza die Miracoli | Source What Is There to See Besides the Tower?The entire tower complex is known as the Piazza die Miracoli, or the Field of Miracles. Four buildings make up the complex, including the Bell Tower (Campanile), the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the cloister that encloses part of the cemetery. The Cathedral of Pisa—one of Italy’s Grand Cathedrals—is a magnificent building that was started in 1063 and completed in 1092, almost 80 years before construction began on the tower. The entire complex is contained within a walled area and is very compact with everything within close proximity to each other. If you venture outside of the complex in search of interesting sites, I’m afraid there is not a great deal to see, at least in my opinion. There is the Botanical Garden, the Piazza del Cavalieri, and a scenic path along the Arno River, but most visitors seem interested in seeing just the tower. I've been to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower, and it's leaning. You look at it, but nothing happens, so then you look for someplace to get a sandwich.— Danny DeVito <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134480_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"The Baptistery\" title=\"The Baptistery\"/>The Baptistery | Source <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134328_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"\"/>Source Hopefully, I haven’t swayed you out of visiting the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It is certainly one of Italy’s most popular attractions, and it draws visitors from all over the world. It’s actually a lot of fun to people watch the crowds in the complex as they try to get their photos and selfies. Like it or not, this tower is a part of Italy’s legacy, and the community of Pisa has gone to great lengths to preserve the tower and make sure that it is safe for visitors to view and climb. Interesting Tower FactsConstruction started in 1173 and finished in 1399. The tower was originally planned to be 60 meters tall. Its height today is 56.67 meters on the high side and 55.86 meters on the low side. Surprisingly, there is confusion and controversy over the number of steps to the top. Various websites range from 250 to 297, which seems like a large margin of error. According to a website I found where they actually counted the steps while filming the ascent, there are 269 steps to the top of the tower. I believe this number is correct. The tower has eight stories, which includes the top floor bell chamber. There are seven bells in the tower, one for each note on the musical major scale. The tower is leaning due to the soft and unstable clay soil upon which it was built, and an inadequate foundation. By 1178, as construction reached the third story, the tower had already begun to lean. A renovation project to secure the tower was completed in 2001. This project made the tower safe for visitors to climb. The engineers that worked on the tower renovation project believe that it is possible to totally straighten it. However, nobody really wants that to happen, especially the community of Pisa that has lived off of the six million annual visitors to the tower for a very long time. Prior to the restoration project, the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees, it now leans at an angle of about 3.99 degrees. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134484_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Cathedral of Pisa\" title=\"Cathedral of Pisa\"/>Cathedral of Pisa | Source Visitor InformationHours:​​ April to Sept: 9 am to 8 pm, except open until 10 pm mid-June through Aug. ​​October: 9 am to 7 pm. ​​November: 9 am to 6 pm. ​​December to February: 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. ​​March: 9 am to 6 pm, 7 pm the last week of the month.

It is accessible by train from Lucca, Florence, and Rome. The trip from Lucca is just 30 minutes, while Florence is about an hour away. How Much Time Should You Spend in Pisa? Expect to spend a few hours to visit the entire tower complex and to take your photos. If you are coming from Lucca or Florence you can definitely do this in half a day and be back in time to enjoy other sites. Rome, while further away, is still doable and will take approximately two and a half hours by train. Should you be arriving by car, there is plenty of parking surrounding the complex. Some of it is free and some requires a fee. If you are arriving by train at the Pisa Central Station, be aware that the tower complex is 2 kilometers away, about a 25-minute walk or a 10-euro taxi ride. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134340_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"2448\" data-height=\"3264\" alt=\"Even I got in on the fun.\" title=\"Even I got in on the fun.\"/>Even I got in on the fun. | Source Our First VisitI mentioned earlier that we have seen the Leaning Tower of Pisa twice. The first time we were staying in a small village called Montemagno. It’s in the hills outside of Pisa and my very first glimpse of the tower was from our B&B window using a long telephoto lens. It was great fun to spot it from about seven miles away, albeit was small and distant. We did get into Pisa on that trip and what I took from that visit was that it is definitely over-hyped, yet a lot of fun to actually see it and create funny photos doing stupid things in front of the tower. This is of course why so many people want to see it, so they can take that coveted selfie or photo struggling to right the tower before it collapses. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134494_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\" title=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\"/>It’a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture. | Source Our Second VisitOur second visit to Pisa was much more recent, and this time we came from Lucca. Pisa is, in fact, a very easy day-trip from Lucca for those who want to get there, see it, and get out of there. Lucca, by the way, is absolutely beautiful and has lots of towers that are higher and just as interesting, in case you were interested. Lucca is a mere 12 miles north of Pisa and a very easy 30-minute train ride away. If your travels are taking you to Lucca, definitely consider taking a few hours to visit Pisa. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14139410_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source <img src=\"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14134479_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source So why did we return to see the tower a second time? We were traveling with friends who had not seen it, and being so close, you can hardly ignore its drawing power. The entire complex, which is contained within a high wall to hide its treasures, can be accessed through a couple of gates. The price you will pay to enter, which is free, is a run through the gauntlet of vendors trying to sell you Pisa trinkets and souvenirs. It’s actually an unwelcome and somewhat tacky introduction to the complex. Once you manage to slither through, however, I think you will be impressed, as I was, at the beautiful green grass that carpets the complex and the stunning cathedral before you. And yes, located just behind the cathedral is the tower that leans, the reason you are here.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

We’ll look at how structures connect to the ground and transmit loads through their foundations, and how those foundations need to provide a high bearing capacity. We’ll see how properties of the soil, like shear strength, affect bearing capacity. We’ll also consider happens when the ground experiences stress from seismic activity and how seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.Crash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Subscribe to Hot Mess: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaE...***RESOURCES:https://www.thebalancesmb.com/leaning...http://environment.uwe.ac.uk/geocal/f...http://www.geotechnicalinfo.com/beari...http://civil.utm.my/azril/files/2016/...http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~cnan/Princi...https://icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/in...https://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schoo...https://www.ramjack.com/houston/about...https://leaningtowerpisa.com/facts/ho...***Crash Course is on Patreon!

Just one little miscalculation made in the 11th century left us with an amazing 14,500 ton leaning tower! Known among Italians as Torre Pendente di Pisa, this piece of architecture is significally different from most medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is located on the city’s main square, Piazza del Duomo. This square is also known as Piazza dei Miracoli, “Miracles’ Square”, a name given by Italian writer Gabriele D’Annunzio. In 1987 the whole square became one of the many Italian UNESCO World Heritage sites! The leaning tower is the third oldest building built in the square, after the wonderful Cathedral and its Baptistry. With its many columns and archs, this tower boasts an advanced knowledge of weight and load characteristics, showing the Italian architectures’ expertise. Why is the tower leaning then? What the architect didn’t account for was the base of the tower, which was built on a dense section of clay… The Early Years of the Leaning Tower of Pisa The construction of the Tower began in 1173. Originally designed to be a bell tower, it stood upright for over 5 years, but when the third floorwas completed in 1178 it began to lean. Italians were shocked by the event, as the tower began to lean ever so slightly. The thing is the foundation of the tower, which is only 3-meter deep, was built on a dense clay mixture. This mix impacted the soil and furthermore the clay was not strong enough to hold the tower upright. As a result the weight of the tower began to diffuse downward until it had found the weakest point. Due to this problem, construction works stopped for 100 years. The government decided to focus on its war with Genoa and hope that the soil would settle in the meantime. Mistake after mistake! After 100 years, engineer Giovanni di Simone stepped forward and started to add more floors to the tower. He tried to compensate for the original lean by making one side of the upper floors taller than the other. This only caused the tower to lean over even more… Unconcerned by the leaning, the tower was added a 7th floor in the second part of the 14th century, as well as a bell tower, and then the tower was left on its own until the 19th century. In 1838 architect Alessandro Della Gherardesca, dug a pathway at the base of the tower to allow people to admire the intricately crafted base. This caused the tower to lean even more, probably due to the digging of its base. Tower survives World War II World War II caused destruction all over the World. The leaning tower of Pisa, however, was very very lucky. In fact when American soldiers invaded Pisa, they were ordered to destroy all buildings as to prevent enemy snipers to find suitable places to hide. There were no exceptions to this rule, and many buildings were blown up everyday, as the US forces advanced over the Italian countryside. However a retreat took place shortly after the arrival of the Americans, making unnecessary to destroy the Leaning Tower of Pisa! And it is still standing! Twenty years after the end of the war Italy asked help to avoid the Leaning Tower from toppling. They didn’t want the tower to lose its leaning though, because it is now the symbol of the city, a landmark loved by tourists from all over the world. As a temporary measure engineers and architects installed a leaden counterweight of 800 tonnes. In 1987 the Leaning Tower of Pisa was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, together with the entire Piazza Del Duomo, but in 1990 it was closed. Its bells were removed and the tower was anchored, only to reopen in 2001.Tourists now can safely visit the leaning tower of Pisa!

Like its name suggest, it actually does lean to one side. The tower started to lean during construction because the foundation was built on soft ground that had difficulty supporting the weight. The lean became worse as construction continued for several decades. Between 1990 and 2001 it was stabilized and the lean was partially fixed. Interesting Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts: In Italian the Leaning Tower of Pisa is Torre pendente di Pisa. It was built as a freestanding bell tower for the cathedral in Pisa. On the side where the tower is lower because of the lean it stands at 187.27 feet. On the high side of the tower it stands at 186 feet. The tower weighs about 14,500 tons. That's a lot of weight for a building to have to support when it has been leaning since it was built. There are approximately 294 steps on the north side and 296 steps on the south side of the tower. The Leaning Tower of Pisa took 344 years to build, beginning in August 1173. It began to lean in 1178 once construction on the second floor had begun. The lean was due to one side sinking into the soft ground. The construction was stopped twice, the first time for 100 years, the second time in 1284. Both times it was due to wars. If it hadn't been for the two pauses in construction it would have taken between 185 and 195 years to complete. Inside the tower there are seven bells. Each bell represents one note of the musical major scale. The first stones used to form the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa were purchased with the money left to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie by Donna Berta di Bernardo in 1172. Nobody seems to be able to pinpoint the identity of who the actual original architect really was. During World War II, the Allies heard that Germans were using the Leaning Tower of Pisa as an observation post. Once the Allies saw how beautiful the tower was they refrained from destroying it. The Leaning Tower of Pisa became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Also included in this designation were the cathedral, cemetery and the baptistery. In 1989 another tower called the Civic Tower of Pavia collapsed. This sped up the restoration efforts for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The tower was closed to the public from 1989 until 2001, after the restoration was complete. It is thought that the restoration will keep the Leaning Tower of Pisa stable for at 300 years more. In 2008 engineers stated that the Tower had stopped moving. This is the first time in its history that it has not been slowly leaning further to one side. If the construction of the tower had not been halted the first time due to war it would have toppled over. The hundred years it had to sit helped to let it settle (compact). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a circular shape and has eight floors. The 7 bells are located on the eighth floor. Some people have suggested that the tower should be straightened. The people have Pisa had said they would rather see it fall over than be straightened. After all, how could you call it the Leaning Tower of Pisa if it didn't lean? medianet_width = \"600\"; medianet_height = \"280\"; medianet_crid = \"426465885\"; medianet_versionId = \"3111299\"; Related Links: Facts Wonders of the World Facts Animals Facts (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); <a href=\"http://www.softschools.com/facts/wonders_of_the_world/leaning_tower_of_pisa_facts/93/\">Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts</a> var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\"); document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\")); var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-286169-1\"); pageTracker._initData(); pageTracker._trackPageview(); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-2\"); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-220826598243468550-3'); }); More Topics Handwriting Spanish Facts Examples Formulas Difference Between Inventions Literature Flashcards 2019 Calendar Online Calculators Multiplication Educational Videos"}],"keywords":["description"]},{"url":"https://www.livitaly.com/leaning-tower-of-pisa-history/","title":"The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours","sections":[{"title":"main","content":"Italy Travel Blog The Leaning Tower of Pisa History & Facts | LivItaly Tours April 18, 2018 The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures in Italy & the world, so it’s little surprise that it draws in over 1 million visitors each year to see and take photos with the amazing monument. It has been depicted in numerous books, movies, and cartoons, so it’s little surprise that there are so many stories and tales about the tower. This stunning structure stands (or leans) in the city of Pisa, which is a short ride from Florence, the capital city of central Italy’s Tuscany region. The tower is the third oldest structure in the city’s Piazza del Duomo, or “Cathedral Square” in English. Most people are familiar with the tower from seeing photographs of their friends and family posing next to them (don’t worry we have all done it) but many don’t know much more about the intriguing history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Leaning Tower of Pisa History As the city of Pisa grew as an important Italian seaport, its people wanted to emphasize its significance with a cathedral complex. This so-called “Field of Miracles” included a baptistery, a cathedral & of course, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was then built to serve as the bell tower. Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began in 1137, but it was not completed until the mid-14th century due to war, debt, and other interruptions which stalled its construction. Trying to find out the exact history of the Leaning Tower of Pisa is a little bit more complex than you may think. The design of the tower has historically been attributed to the 12th century Italian artist Bonanno Pisano, who was most well-known for his bronze castings. While his name was found in a shard of cast at the foot of the tower in the early 19th century, some historians argue that this is not evidence of his contribution and that the cast may instead be related to the cathedral that was destroyed in the late 16th century. In more recent times, some researchers have suggested that Diotisalvi might have been the original architect, because he designed the Baptistery and the bell tower of San Nicola in Pisa, and all of these works show some resemblance to each other. Guglielmo has been said to have lain the foundations of the tower, and a builder named Gerardo di Gerardo has also been credited with the early phases of construction. Giovani di Simone was involved in the second phase and Tommaso Pisano in the final phase.

So obviously everyone knows the tower because it leans – but the tower was not purposefully designed to lean. Due to the soft ground that the tower was built on and shifting soil upon which it was built, it served to destabilize the foundation. The tower had begun to lean by the time its builders reached the third story. Over time, it began to fall about two millimeters per year, until it was leaning at an angle of 5.5 degrees. Restoration work has taken place in the late 20th century to make sure that the tower doesn’t fall over, however, the leaning tower of Pisa now leans a little less than 4 degrees. It is now thought that the tower will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries but in fact, it may never fall. In the wake of this careful restoration project and the attraction’s re-opening, there has never been a better time to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa! How Was the Leaning Tower of Pisa Used? In legend, Galileo used the tower to prove that the speed of a falling object is independent of its mass. He supposedly dropped different weights of cannonballs from the top of the tower. The Germans were also suspected to have used the tower for observation during the Second World War. Eventually it became a major tourist attraction, full of people attempting to take the perfect photo. The Leaning Tower was closed to the public from 1990-2001 for stabilization, but it has since been reopened. The tower was on the brink of collapse not long ago. However, because of the restoration project conducted in the 1990s, which called upon the expertise of mathematicians, scientists, architects, and other talents, it is now thought that the Tower of Pisa will lean at its current angle, without falling, for another two centuries. In fact, it may never fall. Kathleen Bello I am so grateful to find your particular post.

As a vital seaport and a major center of trade, many people visited the city. In the early days, Pisa was a popular resting place for pilgrims from Europe on their way to Jerusalem. The military fleet of Pisa was most successful. In 871 the fleet helped defend the Salerno from attackers, and it was Pisans that forced the Arab troops from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia in 1015. The city of Pisa, Italy As their riches and influence increased, the city of Pisa, Italy, became more and more powerful. The island of Corsica came under Pisan control in 1077, and in 1113 so did the Balearic Islands near Spain. The Pisans enjoyed a time of great prosperity The decline of Pisa began in 1284 when Genoa defeated the Pisans in battle. The islands controlled by Pisa were lost and the influence began to decline. By the 15th century the Arno River had become so filled with silt that it completely cut off Pisa from the sea. This marked the end of Pisa as a useful port and the end of its wealth and power. Pisa Tower Construction In 1174, engineer Bonnano Pisano laid a marble foundation large enough to park about 16 Ferrari 328s in and started building the campanile for the cathedral and baptistry of Pisa. The Romanesque Tower of Pisa, comprising 14,000 tonnes of white marble, was completed 176 years later – but it was also embarrassingly crooked. Because there was a lot of water under the ground in this area, Bonnano was able to place the foundation only about 10 feet down into the ground. As the first story of the tower was completed, the south side began to sink. The builders tried to make it look better by building the columns and arches on the south side about an inch taller than those on the north side. However by the time they got to the fourth story, they had to make the southern columns 2 inches taller than the northern ones. The tower just continued to lean, and because of the difficulties the construction was stopped. Pisa Tower Architecture In 1234, the architect Benenato discovered that the tower was leaning even more. Now the south side of the fourth story was a full 6 inches shorter than the north side. He added a fifth story, again making the south columns taller than the north ones. After adding that one story, Benenato gave up, and again construction on the tower stopped. Almost thirty years later, in 1260, William of Innsbruck added the sixth and seventh stories to the Tower of Pisa. In 1350 Tommaso Pisano started work on the eighth story of the tower, the bell chamber. He found that the tower was still sinking, and so he made the spiral stairs inside the tower and the wall of the bell chamber higher on the south side than on the north. The tower was finally completed in 1372, almost 200 years after it was begun, and it was still leaning.

It is a bell tower. It is famous because it is not vertical. In 1990 the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees and increasing. After that, much restoration work has been done to stop it from falling over completely. There was scaffolding all around the tower for 20 years. On 26 April 2011, the last bit of scaffolding was removed so that the tower can be seen properly again.[1] The height of the tower is about 56 metres from the ground. Its weight is about 14,500 tonnes. It now leans at about 3.99 degrees. The tower has 294 steps. When the second floor was built in 1178, the tower started to lean. This was because it had a small three-meter foundation in soft soil. The design of this tower was bad from the beginning. Construction was stopped for almost 100 years because the people of Pisa were often at war with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. There is an old story that Galileo Galilei used the Tower for a physics experiment.

2018Original:Dec 3, 2015Why does the Leaning Tower of Pisa lean?Author:Sarah PruittPick any day in the Piazza del Duomo in the Italian city of Pisa, and you will undoubtedly spot a bunch of tourists posing for the same photo: hands outstretched towards the cathedral’s conspicuously tilting bell tower, as if they are supporting it with their sheer strength. The so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most famous buildings in the world, although maybe not for the reasons its original architects would have wanted. In 1173, construction began on a white marble bell tower for the cathedral complex in Pisa, located between the Arno and Serchio rivers in Tuscany, central Italy. By the time builders had finished the third of eight planned stories about five years later, the tower’s foundation had begun to settle unevenly on the ground beneath it, a dense mixture of clay, sand and shells. As a result, the structure had begun to tilt visibly toward the south. Shortly after that, war broke out between Pisa and Genoa, another Italian city-state, halting construction for nearly a century. This delay allowed the foundation to settle further, likely prevented the bell tower’s premature collapse. When construction resumed, chief engineer Giovanni di Simone tried to compensate for the lean by adding extra masonry to the short side, but the additional weight caused the structure to tilt even further. The tower was officially completed around 1370, but its lean only increased over the next six centuries, becoming an integral part of the monument’s quirky appeal. Despite various attempts to reinforce it, Pisa’s tower continued to subside at a rate of some 0.05 inches per year, placing it in increasing danger of collapse. By 1990, it was leaning 5.5 degrees (or some 15 feet) from the perpendicular–the most extreme angle yet. That year, the monument was closed to visitors and the bells removed as engineers started extensive reparations to stabilize it. By siphoning earth from beneath and adding counterweights to the tower’s north end, they were able to reduce the lean to 13.5 feet, or 4.0 degrees from perpendicular. The straightening continued after the tower reopened in 2001, and in 2008 sensors showed the subsiding motion had stopped, after a total improvement of some 19 inches. Engineers now believe the Leaning Tower of Pisa will remain stable for some 200 years, barring an earthquake or other unpredictable disaster.Tagsterms:ItalyEngineeringBy Sarah PruittFACT CHECK: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

(Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) In 1990 an international team of engineers, mathematicians, and historians met on the Azores Islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Their task was to figure out how to save an 800-year-old historic building that was close to collapsing. The structure was then tilted by 5.5 degrees to one side. If something wasn't done soon, the world famous Leaning Tower of Pisa would come crashing to the ground. The structure was originally meant to simply be a free standing bell tower (or campanile) for the city of Pisa's cathedral. Such towers were commonly built in 10th century Italy to symbolize the town's power and economic wealth. Historians aren't sure who the structure's original architect might be. For many years it was thought to be Bonanno Pisano, a Pisa resident and artisan noted for creating a number of ornate bronze doors for cathedrals. However, scholars now suspect that Diotisalvi, who was the architect of Pisa's San Nicola bell tower and the city's baptistery, might actually be responsible. Seven Quick Facts Height: 183 feet, 3 inches (55.8m) Angle of tilt: 3.97 degrees - 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) off vertical Steps to top: 296 Construction: Started 1173, finished 1372 Function: Bell Tower for the Cathedral at Pisa, Italy Built of: Masonry and Marble Other: Contains 7 bells tuned to the major musical scale In either case we know that construction on the tower started in 1173 AD near the city's cathedral on a piece of land known as Piazza dei Miracoli (\"Square of Miracles\"). The tower was round and 52 feet (16m) in diameter at the base with a projected height of 191 feet (58m). The first level was to be taller than the rest and have an elaborate entry portal decorated with sculptures of monsters and animals. The second story would have open marble arcades with many columns. On top of that there would be five more levels with facades similar to the second story. Finally, the roof would be capped with a bell chamber designed to contain 7 bells. Imperfect from the Beginning By the time the third floor was finished in 1178, it was clear that the tower was leaning slightly to the northwest. The problem was that the foundation was only 10 feet (3m) deep and the soil underneath was soft and unstable. The citizens of Pisa decided to stop construction for a while and let the tower settle a bit with the hope that it would straighten itself out, or at least stop moving. In any case, several wars with neighboring towns required their attention. The tower now leans 3.97 degrees off of true.(Photo by Softeis. Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license) It was almost a hundred years before they got back to doing more work on it. In 1272, under the direction of Giovanni di Simone, construction resumed. To try and compensate for the tilt, he designed the upper stories so that they had one side slightly taller than the other. By the time the 7th floor was completed, it became apparent that the building was moving again and the lean increasing, this time to the south. In 1284 work was halted again due to another war. Finally, the bell tower was finished in 1372. Over the next few centuries the 7 bells would be installed in the bell chamber, one for each note of the musical major scale. The tower continued to move and by the 16th century it was a full 3 degrees off vertical. Pisa's campanile, however, wasn't the only European tower that was crooked. Over the years many of these collapsed or were replaced with newer structures. Pisa's tilted bell tower, however, survived and eventually became a major landmark not despite its lean, but because of it. In 1911 engineers began careful measurements of the tower's angle and realized that it was still moving at the rate of a 1/20 of an inch per year. In 1934 engineers working for the dictator Benito Mussolini - who found the tilt an offense to his Fascist ideals - attempted to correct the problem by injecting 200 tons of concrete under the foundation. This, however, just made the problem worse. By 1989 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees and its top was out of plumb by 17 feet (5m). Its predicament was underscored when a similar bell tower in the town of Pavia unexpectedly collapsed. Officials decided to close the Pisa's tower to visitors, evacuate the area under it and put together an international team to figure out how to save it. Fixing the Tower One of the seven bells housed in the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018)) Team member John Burland, a soil mechanics specialist from Imperial College London, wondered if removing soil from under the tower's northern foundation might help correct the tilt. After running a number of computer simulations, the team decided that such a strategy was their best bet. To keep the building from coming apart while they worked on it, a number of temporary measures were put in place. First, steel bands were wrapped around the first floor to support the masonry there. Then, 827 tons of lead weights were placed on the northern side of the building to act as a counter-balance. A concrete ring was also placed around the building at the third level connected to heavy steel cables anchored in the ground to keep the structure from any further southern movement. Finally the massive bells were removed to decrease the total weight of the building. With these measures in place, the team drilled a hole at an angle under the northern side of the tower to remove some earth. Over a number of years they repeated this procedure while measuring what it did to the tilt of the tower. A total of 41 holes were made removing 77 tons of soil causing the tower to move backwards toward a more stable position. By 2001 the tower had moved back to the same lean it had in the 1930's and officials decided it was safe to reopen the structure to visitors. The intention was never to straighten the tower completely. It still leans 3.97 degrees out of true with the top being 12 feet, 10 inches (4m) from vertical. The cables and other temporary measures have been removed. Engineers believe they have stabilized the tilt so that the tower should be safe for at least several hundred years, barring a major incident like an earthquake. Looking up at the tower. (Copyright Lee Krystek, 2018) That's a relief to the citizens of Pisa for whom the well-loved, but off-kilter tower is a world recognized icon for their town and a source of tourist dollars. The structure isn't only known for the great beauty of its Romanesque architecture but also for its historical significance. Galileo Galilei, the astronomer, is said to have dropped a cannon ball and a musket ball from the tower to prove that weight does not affect how fast an object falls. While his conjecture indeed proved true, historians have called into question whether he actually did his test from the top of the tower at Pisa. Even so, the tower remains strongly associated in people's minds with the great scientist. Why Does it Stand At All? One of the mysteries of the tower is not just why it leans, but why it continues to stand at all. The area around Pisa is subject to earthquakes and the tower has lived through at least four major quakes during its life, yet even as off-kilter as it is, it still stands. In 2018 a study led by Roma Tre University's Professor Camillo Nuti suggests that the reason it leans is the exact same reason it still stands. \"Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Pisa tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events,\" noted Professor George Mylonakis, from the University of Bristol, UK, who was a member of the team that worked on the study. According to the report the softness of the soil, combined with the stiffness of the tower, prevents it from resonating, or vibrating along, with the earthquake's ground motion and protects the structure from damage. In 1987 the tower, along with the associated cathedral, baptistery and cemetery, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The tower has also been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. Ironically, while the preservation efforts have saved the tower, they have also caused it to lose the title of the most crooked structure in the world, This distinction now goes to the leaning tower of Suurhusen, in Germany, which is 5.3 degrees out of true.

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

This is certainly true of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a monument striking for its tilt of approximately 4 degrees. Bonanno Pisano, Campanile (Leaning Tower), exterior, 1174-1350, Pisa, Italy. (c) 2006, SCALA, Florence / ART RESOURCE, N.Y., artres.com, scalarchives.com The tilt was even more pronounced before modern efforts at stabilization began, and by some accounts has reached 8-10 degrees in past centuries. But while stabilizing the tower has been important to its physical preservation, it may have negatively affected the church’s historical legacy. Since the Leaning Tower of Pisa was straightened out, several other buildings–mainly in Germany and Switzerland–have been vying for the slanted spotlight, as was humorously reported by the New York Times in 2012. However, no attempt at dethroning Pisa as home to the farthest leaning building has been as bold as that of Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. Starting in 2007, the city began work on the Capital Gate, which rises at an 18-degree westward lean–more than four times that of the Leaning Tower of Pisa–along the city’s waterfront. The topography and skyline of Abu Dhabi and of other major cities on the Persian Gulf have been rapidly changing in the past decade, with projects for major museums and cultural centers, shopping malls, offices, and condominiums underway or already completed. In Abu Dhabi alone, two outposts of renowned art museums are in the works – a branch of the Louvre, and a Guggenheim Abu Dhabi designed, respectively, by the famed architects Jean Nouvel and Frank Gehry. RMJM Architects, Capital Gate; overview of the building from nearby mosque exterior, 2010, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Even amid this development, though, the Capital Gate (opened in 2011) remains a unique structure for its arresting form, and the engineering feats that allowed for it. The architectural firm behind the building, RMJM Architects, devised a complex system to ensure that the Capital Gate stays at its intended lean. The building was the first to use what is known as a ‘pre-cambered’ core. 15,000 cubic meters of concrete reinforced with 10,000 tons of steel were sculpted in the opposite direction of the building’s incline and placed slightly off-center at its base. As the building rose, this core was gradually pulled up and compressed into a vertical position to support the mammoth structure. Other design elements employed to reinforce the Capital Gate’s unique shape include a steel exoskeleton, supported by 490 piles drilled 100 feet underground. The interior of the building matches the exterior in opulence. The Capital Gate houses an exhibition center, 20,000 square meters of luxury office space, and a five-star Hyatt hotel. Guests lucky enough to stay in one of the Hyatt’s rooms are greeted by floor-to-ceiling windows displaying a panoramic view of the city through custom-built window paneling. A large, airy atrium fills the central 17th and 18th floors, and contains both a swimming pool and cantilevered tea lounge. The 18th floor is also where the ‘Splash’–a 320-meter metal element that sweeps down from the outside of the building and connects to the nearby Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre–is placed. More than a mere aesthetic flourish, the Splash turns into a canopy for the Centre’s outdoor grandstand, used for viewing parades and other national events. Unsurprisingly, the client behind both buildings is one in the same: the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (ADNEC), a national body that oversees conferences and exhibitions.

Image and original data provided by Art on File, artonfile.com Exhibitions have a way of inspiring futuristic architecture. The Eiffel Tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair; the Unisphere in New York City is a relic of the 1964/5 event; and in 2010 the city of Shanghai completed the Expo Axis, featuring one of the world’s largest membrane roofs, to accommodate the 2010 year’s World Exposition. The Capital Gate’s metallic, undulating shape lends it–and in turn the events it hosts–a cutting-edge appearance at a time when this region is staking its claim as a future international center for business and culture. Despite its bid for dominance in the architectural monuments game, though, Pisa may still have Abu Dhabi beat. The Capital Gate was given the honor of the Guinness World Record for “farthest leaning man-made structure,” but unless something goes awry with its foundation (and let’s hope it doesn’t), Pisa still houses, arguably, the world’s quirkiest and most iconic slanted structure – tilted by human error, not meticulous design plans. – Hannah Stamler You may also be interested in: Contemporary Architecture in the United Arab Emirates Posted in Features Related Posts August 26, 2019 Browsing Artstor just got easier!

(Image: © Library of Congress) Experts say the famous tower at Pisa will lean for at least another 200 years. It may even stay upright well, almost upright forever. That's all thanks to a restoration project, which brought the tower back from the brink of collapse a decade ago.From the first moment of its construction on unstable subsurface soils in 1173, Pisa's bell tower tilted farther and farther to the south. Its early-onset lean even influenced the way it was built, as its architects tried to compensate by angling the structure northward, resulting in its being banana-shaped.A few ill-advised construction projects accelerated the Leaning Tower's invisibly slow fall during the past couple of centuries; it tilted 5.5 degrees, its acutest angle ever, in 1990. By all calculations, the tower should have toppled at just 5.44 degrees, but fortunately it defied the predictions of computer models just long enough for engineers to come up with a fix.Restoration work undertaken from 1999 to 2001 stabilized the tower. Engineers placed weights on the structure's north end, while at the same time extracting soil from below, causing it to slowly sink back in that direction.The Leaning Tower of Pisa still leans south, but now it does so at just 3.99 degrees. Barring a large earthquake or other unforeseen catastrophe, engineers believe it will stay put for at least a few hundred years.How Were the Egyptian Pyramids Built?What Do the Empire State Building's Lights Mean?Why Are Construction Cranes So Dangerous?Follow Life's Little Mysteries on Twitter @llmysteries, then join us on Facebook. window._taboola = window._taboola || []; var taboola_lists = []; function taboola_is_device(device) { if ((! device) || device === null || (typeof device) === 'undefined') return true if (device === 'amp') return false if (device === 'desktop' && window.screen.width >= 700) return true if (device === 'mobile' && window.screen.width < 700) return true return false } if (taboola_is_device(\"desktop\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-f\", container: \"taboola-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"mobile\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-g\", container: \"taboola-mobile-below-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mobile Below Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); } if (taboola_is_device(\"amp\")) { taboola_lists.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-a\", container: \"\", placement: \"below-main-column\", target_type: \"\" }); } for(var i = 0; i < taboola_lists.length; i++){ _taboola.push(taboola_lists[i]); } Sign Up for e-mail newsletters Get breaking science news on monster snakes and dinosaurs, aliens, spooky particles and more!

When we moved to our current location in 1959, the Leaning Tower was one of only four places in town where pizza was available. The price was moderate, with a large pizza ranging from $1.25 to $3.50. Although prices have risen, our pizza remains the same. In a time where corners are cut in the name of “progress”, our recipe hasn’t changed since the day we opened. We still make our own sauce, dough, and sausage, use only the freshest vegetables, herbs and spices, and top our pizza with 100% real cheese.

How do we know? ...we went there and counted ourselves! Believe it or not, no one is reporting this fact right… neither Wikipedia nor Google and not even the signs in “Piazza dei Miracoli” in Pisa, where the Tower stands... or for better use of words, leans.So we went there and we counted the steps one by one ON VIDEO! We had the feeling something was wrong with the steps count when we noticed that practically every web page on the topic reports a different number.Figures range from 250 to 300 and it is very hard to understand who shall be trusted. There are 5 flights of stairs in the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of which is spiraling around the entire building! As far as we can tell, THIS is the only article on the entire Internet reporting the correct number of steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. How can we be so sure? ...tired of mismatching numbers, we went to Pisa and climbed the Tower to count the steps with our own eyes!The figure we got is totally different from anything published online to this date. Yes, we feel your pain... the fact that one cannot really trust information found on the Internet is mind-boggling. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The video of our descent is at the bottom of this article... there you can see how the inside of the Tower looks like and you can even count the steps for yourself! The Stairs in the Leaning Tower First off, there are FIVE different stairs to get to the top of the Tower.Some are just a few steps to access the various parts of the Tower (1st, 2nd, 5th) and two of them are full-size spiral staircases (3rd and 4th) to move between the floors. <ul><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-3.jpeg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/45c18c7b22454c99e10c91d4bf6e3281.jpeg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-5.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/19e09108119c31304b49050bf0dd93ce.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-4.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/0bc58cd05538afd1e09b9f0226093702.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/415b2482fc65c03643b19772ea00ae81.jpg\" width=\"112\" height=\"200\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li><li><a class=\"sigplus-image\" href=\"/images/stairs/leaning-tower-pisa-stairs-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/cache/preview/b4736076b2b55b2354abcadeedd61a9d.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"112\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"sigplus-summary\"></div></li></ul> The first stairs bring from the street level to the base of the Tower, about 150cm lower (5 feet).Once there, you have to climb a few steps to enter the Tower through it’s - one and only - entrance door.Let’s call this stairs nr #2. As you enter the monument, it strikes you… this thing is leaning big time! Like the rest of the Tower, the floor of the entrance room is inclined and you can feel it under your feet. The feeling you get is much stronger than what your eyes perceive from the outside. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The inside of the Tower is hollow. There is only one room with virtually no ceiling. As a matter of fact, the ceiling is about 49m high, on the top of the 7th floor (image on the left). It feels big… and it feels so leaning… On the left of the entrance door, there is the main staircase that leads to the top. It is a spiral staircase that wraps clockwise around the Tower. This is the 3rd staircase you find in the monument (image below). The staircase is pretty narrow and people going up must stop giving the way to those coming down. The stairs climb at regular steps and they are interrupted at each floor by small intermediate landings. At each landing, there is an opening on the outside. Openings are door-sized and they are closed with metal grates to prevent visitors accessing the columns area and walking along the tiny edge… that’d be VERY dangerous. The main staircase ends right at the bottom of the 7th floor. Once you are up, you can walk around the entire circumference of the Tower and admire the wonderful view. You are now walking outside, in the space between the wall of the Tower and the columns of the 7th floor. This space is about 1 meter wide (3 feet) and, like the openings of the floors below, it is protected by metal grates installed right before the columns. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Getting to the Top To get to the top of the 7th floor you have to climb on more flight of stairs (the 4th in the Tower). This last spiral staircase is really tiny and two persons can hardly exchange the way. These stairs land at the base of the bells chamber (8th floor). To enter the bells chamber you have a fifth set of steps to climb (just a few steps). You are now standing inside the bells chamber, on the bottom of the 8th floor.This is the highest point allowed to visitors. There is another flight of tiny stairs that climb up to the very top of the Tower but it is closed to the public since it leads on the tiny edge of the top of the bells chamber (8th floor). You might be surprised to find out that the floor of the 8th story is perfectly flat… well, no wonders, it took 200 years to figure out how to make that happen and they eventually got it right. When you are on the top of the 7th floor you are standing on the tallest building in Pisa. The view is unobstructed in every direction, except for the West, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of majestic Cathedral which very top is the same height as the Tower. The number of Steps It is time to do the math on the actual steps inside the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The first flight of stairs has 8 steps (from street level to the base of the Tower) The second flight has 4 steps (from the base to the inside) On the main staircase there are: 58 steps to reach the 2nd floor 31 steps to reach the 3rd floor 30 steps to reach the 4th floor 30 steps to reach the 5th floor 32 steps to reach the 6th floor 36 steps to reach the 7th floor The fourth flight of stairs to go from the 7th to the 8th floor also counts 36 steps. Finally, there are 4 steps on the short ramp to access the bell chamber (on the 8th floor). Summing up, there are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bells chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. The grand total is 269 steps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, this number is 24 steps shorter of what published in the signs in the Square of Miracles, right below the Tower (293), 25-27 steps less than what stated by Wikipedia and 15 steps less than what answered by Google in its Answer box at the moment of writing. Hopefully, Google and Wikipedia will soon acknowledge this mistake and refer to this post as the correct source of information when it comes to the question “how many steps are in the Leaning Tower of Pisa?”. There are 257 steps to get from the bottom of the Tower to the bell chamber and 12 more steps to enter into the Tower itself. How long does it take to climb the Tower? At this point, you might wonder how long it takes to climb the 257 steps inside the Tower and get a chance to see its seven bells... It took us about 20 minutes to climb up to the top of the monument, including the time for taking a few photos and dealing with the \"traffic\" inside the Tower. Getting down is about four times faster. The video below was shot on our way down and you can clearly see ALL the steps of the 4th and 3rd staircase... so you can crosscheck our numbers :) Is it worth climbing the Leaning Tower? Entering the Tower is the best way to experience its famous lean.Climbing the main stairs enhances the feeling of \"wrong gravity\" even more as you wobble from left to right when spiraling around the Tower from the ground to the top of the 6th floor. It is definitely worth the time and the 18 EUR of the entrance ticket (see image below). Are there any regulations for visiting the Tower? You can visit the tower without a Guide. Entrance is scheduled in batches, every 15 minutes.Tickets must be purchased at the Ticket Office closeby the Tower. In alternative, you can get your ticket online. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); If you get the ticket on-site, you can expect a waiting time of 1-2 hours... therefore it is recommended to buy the ticket online. Make sure you show up at the entrance by the time shown on your ticket cause the tickets are valid only for the time printed on them and they are NOT refundable!

Lienhard Click here for audio of Episode 376. Today, we visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The University of Houston's College of Engineering presents this series about the machines that make our civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity created them. Medieval architects outreached themselves. The Gothic buildings that stand are a remarkable legacy. But we don't see the failures. Well, that isn't entirely so. We see a few. In fact one failure, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is a marvel to see. The Leaning Tower, like many other old Tuscan towers, sits on soft soil. It's only one of many that've gone askew in various ways. But none is more dramatic. Its height, after 800 years of tilting and sinking into the soil, is about 184 feet. I always thought of the Tower as a Renaissance building, but it's older than that. Its construction began way back in 1173. When builders finished the first third, they found it'd tipped 0.2 degrees to the northwest. So they put it on hold for a century. By then the tilt had extended to 0.7 degrees. Yet the city fathers resumed construction anyway. Masons squared off the top of the tilted stump and built upward. The Tower tilted again, this time to the north. They stopped again. For another century the Tower sank and tilted — to the north, to the east, and finally to the south. With the Tower now leaning almost 2 degrees to the south, work went ahead once more in 1373. Masons squared off the top a second time and finished the Tower. Now the top was straight, but the lower portion had a gentle but permanent corkscrew shape. The Tower has continued tilting at an average rate of 21 seconds each year. Now it moves only 7 seconds per year, but that's cold comfort when it leans almost 5½ degrees off vertical — nearly a 10% tilt. And so it stands, majestic and eerie -- defying the rules of fall that Galileo was supposed to have learned on its summit. Walk with me to the top. The stair coils about the outside. You cringe against the wall each time you negotiate the south face and hang over empty space. You reach the summit, short of wind, and gaze out over the ancient intellectual center of Pisa. But there's one more tight circular staircase. Take a deep breath and mount it. Now you gaze down, even on the bells. Nothing more separates you from the blue Tuscan sky. And all the time you wonder what medieval magic keeps the Tower from abruptly finishing its fall while you stand there. Civil engineers have learned what its medieval builders did not know about foundations, but they haven't learned to end the Tower's movement. With an animal obstinacy, it curbs experiments. It responds to each measure by tilting faster. It teases our minds with its crazy, slow-motion, corkscrew fall. I'm John Lienhard, at the University of Houston, where we're interested in the way inventive minds work. (Theme music) Kerisel, J., A Few Hidden Errors in Medieval Architecture. Down to Earth.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day.

The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.[citation needed] Gallery View looking up Entrance door to the bell tower External loggia Inner staircase from sixth to seventh floor Inner staircase from seventh to eighth (the top) floor View from the top Assunta bell Pasquareccia bell View, looking down from the top Leaning Tower of Pisa in 2004 Tourist in a common pose at Tower of Pisa, June 2009 See also Leaning Temple of Huma List of leaning towers Leaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa Leaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower Great Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway Machang, Kelantan, home to another leaning tower Round tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers The Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\" Torre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome Tour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower References ^ \"Leaning Tower of Pisa Facts\".

Its construction was an ambitious project to create a 358-metre (1,175 ft)-high visitor attraction in Wembley Park to the north of the city, led by the railway entrepreneur Sir Edward Watkin. Marketed as the \"Great Tower of London\", it was designed to surpass the height of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and it was part of Wembley Park's emergence as a recreational place. The tower was never completed and it was demolished in 1907. The site of the tower is now occupied by the English national football ground, Wembley Stadium. Contents 1 Names 2 History 2.1 Design and construction 2.2 Opening and demolition 3 Legacy 4 References 5 External links Names[edit] Numerous names and nicknames were given to the tower during its planning, construction and legacy. These include Watkin's Tower,[2] Watkin's Folly,[3] the Wembley Park Tower,[4] the Wembley Tower,[1] the Metropolitan Tower,[4] and the London Stump.[5] History[edit] A caricature of Watkin by \"Ape\", published in Vanity Fair in 1875. Sir Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was a British Member of Parliament and railway entrepreneur, noted for being chairman of nine different British railway companies. He was an ambitious visionary, and presided over large-scale railway engineering projects to fulfil his business aspirations. He began work on the construction of a channel tunnel under the English Channel, with the aim of connecting his lines to the railway network in France, and successfully opened the Great Central Main Line, which was designed to accommodate the larger continental European trains which would cross into Britain from France. Although the channel tunnel project failed in 1881, Watkin remained a driven innovator, inspired by grand schemes which could augment his railway empire.[6] Among his numerous railway executive appointments, Watkin was chairman of the Metropolitan Railway (MR), an expanding London transport company which was later to become the Metropolitan line of the present-day London Underground system. Watkin was keen to attract more passengers onto his trains and was aggressively extending his railway into Buckinghamshire. He also considered transporting Londoners out into the countryside as a business opportunity and needed a major attraction to lure the crowds out of the city and onto his trains. To this end, Watkin purchased a tract of land near a rural Middlesex hamlet called Wembley, adjacent to the route of the Metropolitan Railway, with the goal of building an amusement park laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens (the park land had previously been landscaped by Humphry Repton and known as Wembley Park) in the 18th century), and cricket and football pitches. The crowning glory of Watkin's amusement park was to be a soaring metal tower which would be centrepiece of the pleasure park and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station.[6][7] The paying public was to gain access to Wembley Park and its tower by train, arriving at the new Wembley Park station which the Metropolitan Railway constructed specially for the attraction, incorporating additional platforms to handle the large crowds which Watkin confidently anticipated would flock to the park. The station opened in 1893-4.[8] Design and construction[edit] .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{display:flex;flex-direction:row;clear:left;flex-wrap:wrap;width:100%;box-sizing:border-box}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{margin:1px;float:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theader{clear:both;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;align-self:center;background-color:transparent;width:100%}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:left;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption-center{text-align:center;background-color:transparent}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-left{text-align:left}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-right{text-align:right}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-center{text-align:center}@media all and (max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;max-width:none!important;align-items:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trow{justify-content:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsingle{float:none!important;max-width:100%!important;box-sizing:border-box;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaption{text-align:center}}The winning design of Watkin's Tower (proposal n°37), later scrapped and replaced by a four-legged designThe final four-legged design of Watkin's Tower (shown with the Eiffel Tower for comparison purposes) Inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Watkin invited Gustave Eiffel himself to design the tower, but the Frenchman declined – replying that if he designed the tower, the French people \"would not think me so good a Frenchman as I hope I am.\"[5] An architectural design competition was held in 1890, and a total of 68 designs were submitted. Some of the more exotic proposals included a £1m tower inspired by the Tower of Pisa; a structure with \"a captive parachute to hold four persons\"; and a tower with a spiral railway climbing its exterior. One design included a 1/12-scale model of the Great Pyramid of Giza, envisioned as a \"colony of aerial vegetarians, who would grow their own food in hanging gardens\".[5] The winning entry, number 37, was submitted by Stewart, MacLaren and Dunn of London. They proposed an eight-legged 1,200-foot (366 m) metal tower – 45.8 metres (150 ft) taller than the Eiffel Tower, which was 312.2 metres (1,024 ft) at the time.[9][10] It was to have two observation decks – each with restaurants, theatres, dancing rooms and exhibitions – winter gardens, Turkish baths[3] and a 90-bedroom hotel. The top of the tower, reached by a system of lifts, was to provide a fresh-air sanatorium and an astronomical observatory, taking advantage of the clearer air offered by the altitude. The entire structure was to be illuminated by electric light.[6][11] Watkin formed a company to manage the project, the International Tower Construction Company and to oversee construction he appointed Benjamin Baker, a civil engineer who was involved in the design of the Forth Bridge and the Aswan Dam. After an unsuccessful appeal for public subscription, the company could only proceed with the project with its own funds; Watkin commissioned a redesign and the octagonal design was scaled back to a cheaper, four-legged design that bore much more resemblance to the Eiffel Tower. The foundations were laid in 1892 and construction work commenced in June 1893. At the same time, the surrounding park began to be laid out with a cricket pitch and a boating lake, in readiness for the first visitors.[1][7] Opening and demolition[edit] The first and only completed stage of Watkin's Wembley Tower (c.1900) Wembley Park officially opened to the public in May 1894, although construction of the tower was still underway and the first stage had not yet been completed. Nevertheless, the park attracted 12,000 visitors during 1895 and was proving to be a popular attraction for Londoners. In September 1895 the first stage of the tower was completed, standing at approximately 47 metres (154 ft) high.[7] At this time, work was behind schedule as Watkin retired through ill health. It was soon discovered that the structure's foundations were unsteady — the reduction in the number of the tower's legs, carried out to reduce costs, had resulted in increased pressure on each leg and this was causing subsidence.[1][4] Over the next few years, the construction company experienced problems financing the project and went into voluntary liquidation in 1899. Work stopped, and the tower was never completed. Watkin died in 1901, and with halted construction, the \"unsafe\" site was closed to the public the following year.[3] The completed section of the tower was demolished using dynamite in 1904 to 1907.[3][12] Despite the failure and destruction of Watkin's star attraction, Wembley Park continued to flourish as a popular recreation venue, offering football, cricket, cycling, rowing, athletics and in winter, ice skating on the frozen lake. By the end of World War I, over a hundred sports clubs used the Wembley facilities. In order to recoup its losses, the tower construction company turned to house building and was re-incorporated as the Wembley Park Estate Company in 1906, laying out the Wembley suburb with exclusive homes and a golf course.[7] After the war, Wembley was selected as the site for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the park land was purchased from the Metropolitan Railway company. Among the pavilions and halls designed for the exhibition by John William Simpson, Maxwell Ayrton and Owen Williams was a grand sports arena, the 125,000-capacity British Empire Exhibition Stadium, later to be known as Wembley Stadium. It was built on the site of Watkin's Tower, covering its foundations, and opened in 1923, and later became the home ground of the England national football team. When the original stadium was rebuilt in 2000–2003, the lowering of the level of the pitch resulted in the concrete foundations of the tower being rediscovered on the stadium site underneath the Twin Towers.[5] A comparative diagram of Watkin's Tower with the Eiffel tower and London buildings Legacy[edit] Blackpool Tower (erected 1894) Wembley Park station, originally opened to bring visitors to Watkin's Tower Watkin's Folly was not the last attempt to build a notable British tower. In the north west of England, the Blackpool Tower (1894), New Brighton Tower (1896) and Morecambe Tower (1898) were also built, although only the Blackpool Tower remains standing. Although Watkin's tower has gone, Wembley Park continues to attract large crowds to sporting and musical events at Wembley Stadium, and it served as a venue for both the 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics. The station built by the Metropolitan Railway remains in service to this day, providing a major transport link for Wembley crowds via the London Underground Metropolitan and Jubilee lines. A large Irish pub and restaurant in the area is called Watkin's Folly. The story of Watkin's Tower was recounted briefly in the 1973 BBC documentary by the then Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman, Metro-land. In the programme, Betjeman described Watkin's vision of creating an engineering wonder in a little-known rural area north of London: “ Beyond Neasden there was an unimportant hamlet where for years the Metropolitan didn't stop. Wembley. Slushy fields and grass farms. Then out of the mist arose Sir Edward Watkin's dream: an Eiffel Tower for London. ” — Sir John Betjeman, Metro-Land The programme also showed some of the unsuccessful designs for the tower. The script for Metro-land can be found in Betjeman's England, a collection of writings by John Betjeman published in 2009.[13] References[edit] Information taken from London as it Might Have Been by Felix Barker and Ralph Hyde, 1982, .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:\"\\\"\"\"\\\"\"\"'\"\"'\"}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Lock-green.svg/9px-Lock-green.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg/9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(\"//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png\")no-repeat;background-position:right .1em center}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:inherit;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}ISBN 0-7195-3857-2 ^ a b c d Spencer, Adam (1995).

But behind that famous tilt is a fascinating history including plundered loot, treacherous subsoil, hundreds of years of engineering missteps and one proud Italian dictator. If you’ve ever wondered how history’s most famous architectural mishap went down, check out our list of the 10 things you didn’t know about the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The beautiful Field of Miracles came with Pisa’s rise in power | Photo by Steve Slater The tower was built to show off (with stolen money) The 12th century was a good one for Pisa; the city’s military, commercial, and political importance grew as their once small seaport became a regional powerhouse. Like any prosperous medieval Italian city, Pisa began to invest its new wealth in the construction grand buildings. After sacking Palermo in 1063 the city government needed a place to display all of the treasures that adventurers had brought back from Sicily so they decided to construct the “Field of Miracles” which would eventually be home to a Cathedral, Baptistery, cemetery, and one very tall bell tower. In fact, the bell tower was meant to be the tallest of its age and probably would have been if circumstances hadn’t thrown a wrench into the works. The lean didn’t happen overnight Given that the name “Pisa” comes from the Greek word for “marshy land” you would think that the cathedral’s architects would have taken the subsoil into account while building a very tall bell tower. They didn’t. By giving the tower a shallow and relatively heavy foundation, they inadvertently doomed it from the outset. But it wasn’t until the second story was being built that the tower began to sink on one side. Unfortunately, by then it was too late to turn back. As construction continued the builders tried to offset their mistake by adding taller columns and arches on the south side of the tower. But by the time they reached the fourth story (out of a planned 8) they had to make the arches on the south side a full two inches taller than those on the north and the tower still continued to lean. Unsure of what to do next, the builders halted construction for almost a century. It’s not the only leaning tower in Pisa The octagonal bell tower of the San Nicola Church leans as well! | Photo via VisitTuscany Due to the soft subsoil of the entire area, there are actually several leaning towers of Pisa. You can see two others in Pisa’s Borgo Stretto. The bell tower of the Church of St. Nicola is perhaps the most famous after the official Leaning Tower of Pisa. Built around the same time as the tower, in 1170, this octagonal bell tower also boasts a slight but unmistakable slouch. There’s also the bell tower at the church of St. Michele dei Scalzi, located on Viale delle Piagge. Actually, the name “Piagge” comes from the Latin for “low plains prone to flooding.” For all the genius of medieval Pisans, they weren’t particularly good at heeding historical warnings. The tower has leaned in multiple directions Multiple engineers tried, over hundreds of years to correct the famous lean. When construction began again on the third story in the 13th century, engineers tried to stop the tilt by building straight upwards, but the center of gravity was thrown off and the tower simply began to lean in a different direction. As construction continued the tower eventually settled back into its southward tilt, where it has stayed ever since. The lean creates some interesting imbalances The leaning tower of Pisa was supposed to be 60 meters tall (196.85 feet). After the lean, however, the highest side of the tower reaches a mere 56.67 meters (about 186 feet), while the lowest side is 55.86m, or 183 feet. By 1990 the tower had reached a tilt of 5.5 degrees – nearly 15 feet from its base and enough to topple it over by most calculations! Luckily, this considerable tilt was enough to overcome the world-famous inertia of Italian bureaucracy and kick start a massive restoration program that reduced the tilt to *only* 3.97 degrees. Because of the tower’s original list, the north side staircase has something like 296 steps to the top, while the south side has just 294. Wars and economic strife may have saved the tower Debt and war typically have not been boons to great construction projects in Italy, but in the case of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, they may have just been a saving grace. Some structural engineers theorize that continued delays in construction over 200 years may have given the soil underneath the already-slightly-leaning tower time to compress, ultimately saving it from toppling over. You can climb to the top That’s right – the most famous structurally unsound building in the world is open to visitors. Seriously though, since its restoration and slight un-tilting, the structure’s integrity is monitored constantly and the building hosts large numbers of visitors every day. If you want to climb to the top you should book tickets in advance. The seven bells at the top have not rung since last century One of the Leaning Tower of Pisa’s seven bells. | Photo by Leandro Neumann Ciuffo Each of these large bells (the largest weighs nearly 8,000 pounds) represents a musical note from the major scale. Though you can still see them if you climb to the top of the tower, they haven’t tolled since the 20th century – By now you can probably guess why. Restorers and engineers worried that their movements would make the tower lean even more. Mussolini hated the tower and made it worse Italy’s 20th-century dictator, Benito Mussolini, was ashamed of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. He considered its mistaken construction and subsequent lean a national disgrace and an embarrassment to Italy’s reputation. So as with many of the things that he considered shortcoming of Italy, he set out to fix it. Unlike some of his other projects, like draining the swamps of Sicily, it didn’t go well. The idea was to drill hundreds of holes in the base of the tower and pump in grout and mortar to essentially ballast the entire structure and set it straight. In reality, all this accomplished was to create an even heavier base that made the tower lean even more than it had before. The Allies intended to destroy the tower during WWII American soldiers had orders to tear down any and all buildings in Italy that could serve as lookout points or “nests” for enemy snipers during World War Two. In fact, the Germans who were occupying Italy at the time did often use the tower as a lookout, but it’s said that when the Allies arrived they were so impressed by the beauty of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the surrounding Field of Miracles that they decided not to level the area. The tower is currently stable Lead counterweights are stacked on the tower during restoration in 1998. Photo by Rolf Gebhardt The tower has survived centuries of well-meaning but misguided attempts to right it, including various engineers who added levels and arches of all different heights and one overzealous group who dug around the tower to open an underground tour (which only helped to fill the area with even more water). But someone finally got it right in the 21st century and as of 2001, the tower was officially declared stable for at least the next 200 years. In 2008 engineers found that the tower is officially no longer moving – the first time in its history that it hasn’t been slowly listing to one side. 200 years from now, let’s just hope we have the technology to save the tower for another 200!

To be honest, I’m just not really sure what all the fuss is about. It’s just one of the hundreds of towers found throughout Italy, except this one happens to be leaning. In fact, this is not the only leaning tower in Italy! I distinctly recall seeing one in Venice and another on the island of Burano. A little research tells me that there are actually seven leaning towers in Italy, and three of them are located in Venice. So take that Pisa. Would I incorporate Pisa into a planned itinerary? No! If I am in the vicinity would I make an effort to see it? Absolutely! So the obvious question is should you make the time to get to Pisa to see this famous Italian landmark, and is it worth the effort? The answer really depends on where you are coming from and how much time, energy, and money you are willing to spend to see it. To be honest, there are plenty of other interesting sites to see across Italy, so dedicating half a day to a full day just to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa means less time spent elsewhere. On the flip side, we are all tourists at heart, and certainly, there is something about this tower that lures visitors from all over the world, so why not see it? I will tell you that I have actually been to Pisa twice to see the tower. Neither visit was really planned, but because we were close by, it was easy to get to and we figured we might as well see it. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134478_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Piazza die Miracoli\" title=\"Piazza die Miracoli\"/>Piazza die Miracoli | Source What Is There to See Besides the Tower?The entire tower complex is known as the Piazza die Miracoli, or the Field of Miracles. Four buildings make up the complex, including the Bell Tower (Campanile), the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the cloister that encloses part of the cemetery. The Cathedral of Pisa—one of Italy’s Grand Cathedrals—is a magnificent building that was started in 1063 and completed in 1092, almost 80 years before construction began on the tower. The entire complex is contained within a walled area and is very compact with everything within close proximity to each other. If you venture outside of the complex in search of interesting sites, I’m afraid there is not a great deal to see, at least in my opinion. There is the Botanical Garden, the Piazza del Cavalieri, and a scenic path along the Arno River, but most visitors seem interested in seeing just the tower. I've been to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It's a tower, and it's leaning.

It is certainly one of Italy’s most popular attractions, and it draws visitors from all over the world. It’s actually a lot of fun to people watch the crowds in the complex as they try to get their photos and selfies. Like it or not, this tower is a part of Italy’s legacy, and the community of Pisa has gone to great lengths to preserve the tower and make sure that it is safe for visitors to view and climb. Interesting Tower FactsConstruction started in 1173 and finished in 1399. The tower was originally planned to be 60 meters tall. Its height today is 56.67 meters on the high side and 55.86 meters on the low side. Surprisingly, there is confusion and controversy over the number of steps to the top. Various websites range from 250 to 297, which seems like a large margin of error. According to a website I found where they actually counted the steps while filming the ascent, there are 269 steps to the top of the tower. I believe this number is correct. The tower has eight stories, which includes the top floor bell chamber. There are seven bells in the tower, one for each note on the musical major scale. The tower is leaning due to the soft and unstable clay soil upon which it was built, and an inadequate foundation. By 1178, as construction reached the third story, the tower had already begun to lean. A renovation project to secure the tower was completed in 2001. This project made the tower safe for visitors to climb. The engineers that worked on the tower renovation project believe that it is possible to totally straighten it. However, nobody really wants that to happen, especially the community of Pisa that has lived off of the six million annual visitors to the tower for a very long time. Prior to the restoration project, the tower was leaning at 5.5 degrees, it now leans at an angle of about 3.99 degrees. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134484_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"Cathedral of Pisa\" title=\"Cathedral of Pisa\"/>Cathedral of Pisa | Source Visitor InformationHours:​​ April to Sept: 9 am to 8 pm, except open until 10 pm mid-June through Aug. ​​October: 9 am to 7 pm. ​​November: 9 am to 6 pm. ​​December to February: 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. ​​March: 9 am to 6 pm, 7 pm the last week of the month.

It is accessible by train from Lucca, Florence, and Rome. The trip from Lucca is just 30 minutes, while Florence is about an hour away. How Much Time Should You Spend in Pisa? Expect to spend a few hours to visit the entire tower complex and to take your photos. If you are coming from Lucca or Florence you can definitely do this in half a day and be back in time to enjoy other sites. Rome, while further away, is still doable and will take approximately two and a half hours by train. Should you be arriving by car, there is plenty of parking surrounding the complex. Some of it is free and some requires a fee. If you are arriving by train at the Pisa Central Station, be aware that the tower complex is 2 kilometers away, about a 25-minute walk or a 10-euro taxi ride. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134340_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"2448\" data-height=\"3264\" alt=\"Even I got in on the fun.\" title=\"Even I got in on the fun.\"/>Even I got in on the fun. | Source Our First VisitI mentioned earlier that we have seen the Leaning Tower of Pisa twice. The first time we were staying in a small village called Montemagno. It’s in the hills outside of Pisa and my very first glimpse of the tower was from our B&B window using a long telephoto lens. It was great fun to spot it from about seven miles away, albeit was small and distant. We did get into Pisa on that trip and what I took from that visit was that it is definitely over-hyped, yet a lot of fun to actually see it and create funny photos doing stupid things in front of the tower. This is of course why so many people want to see it, so they can take that coveted selfie or photo struggling to right the tower before it collapses. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14134494_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" alt=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\" title=\"It&rsquo;a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture.\"/>It’a blurry due to the distance and using the digital zoom on my camera but you get the picture. | Source Our Second VisitOur second visit to Pisa was much more recent, and this time we came from Lucca. Pisa is, in fact, a very easy day-trip from Lucca for those who want to get there, see it, and get out of there. Lucca, by the way, is absolutely beautiful and has lots of towers that are higher and just as interesting, in case you were interested. Lucca is a mere 12 miles north of Pisa and a very easy 30-minute train ride away. If your travels are taking you to Lucca, definitely consider taking a few hours to visit Pisa. <img src=\"https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14139410_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source <img src=\"https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14134479_f520.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"768\" data-height=\"1024\" alt=\"\"/>Source So why did we return to see the tower a second time? We were traveling with friends who had not seen it, and being so close, you can hardly ignore its drawing power. The entire complex, which is contained within a high wall to hide its treasures, can be accessed through a couple of gates. The price you will pay to enter, which is free, is a run through the gauntlet of vendors trying to sell you Pisa trinkets and souvenirs. It’s actually an unwelcome and somewhat tacky introduction to the complex. Once you manage to slither through, however, I think you will be impressed, as I was, at the beautiful green grass that carpets the complex and the stunning cathedral before you. And yes, located just behind the cathedral is the tower that leans, the reason you are here.

The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry. The height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons).[1] The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase. The tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees.[2][3][4] The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees. Contents 1 Architect 2 Construction 3 History following construction 4 Surviving earthquakes 5 Guinness World Records 6 Technical information 7 Gallery 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Architect There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano,[5] a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.[6] Construction Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower.[7] On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid.[8] Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.[citation needed] Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".[9] The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled.[10] On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.[11] On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower.[12] On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco.[13] In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved.[14] Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.[8][15] The seventh floor was completed in 1319.[16] The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower.[17][18] There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[10] History following construction Between 1589 and 1592,[citation needed] Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. [19][20] During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.[21][22] Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.[23] A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods.[when?] It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base.[24] The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.[25] The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years.[24] In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.[26] After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening,[27] the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.[28] In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.[26] Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 1890s[29] Plaque in memory of Galileo Galilei's experiments Lead counterweights, 1998 The Pisa Baptistery (in the foreground), the Pisa Cathedral (in the middleground), and the Leaning Tower of Pisa (in the background) Surviving earthquakes At least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.[30] Guinness World Records Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[31] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees.[32] In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\";[33] it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.[34] Technical information An elevation image of the Leaning Tower of Pisa cut with laser scan data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, with source image accurate down to 5 mm (0.2 in) Elevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS) Height from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in),[35] 8 stories[36] Height from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)[37] Outer diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)[35] Inner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)[35] Angle of slant: 3.97 degrees[32] or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical[38] Weight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)[39] Thickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in) Total number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale,[40] clockwise:[citation needed] 1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb) 2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb) 3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719–1721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb) 4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb) 5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262[41] by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb) 6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) 7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)[42] Number of steps to the top: 296[43] About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289.[44] A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.[citation needed] The circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below.

Please try again later. Published on Mar 14, 2019This week we’re going underground to explore geotechnical and seismic engineering. We’ll look at how structures connect to the ground and transmit loads through their foundations, and how those foundations need to provide a high bearing capacity. We’ll see how properties of the soil, like shear strength, affect bearing capacity. We’ll also consider happens when the ground experiences stress from seismic activity and how seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.Crash Course Engineering is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Subscribe to Hot Mess: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaE...***RESOURCES:https://www.thebalancesmb.com/leaning...http://environment.uwe.ac.uk/geocal/f...http://www.geotechnicalinfo.com/beari...http://civil.utm.my/azril/files/2016/...http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~cnan/Princi...https://icce-ojs-tamu.tdl.org/icce/in...https://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schoo...https://www.ramjack.com/houston/about...https://leaningtowerpisa.com/facts/ho...***Crash Course is on Patreon!
