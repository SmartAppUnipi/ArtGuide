# Adaptation module

expertiseLevel enumerated

This branch contains the code which provides all the functionalities explained in the architecture sketch.

The folder data contains some examples of text (in .txt format) which should be the input of the text-tailoring functions and some json files, to emulate the REST interaction between modules.

Notice that the adaptation module will receive 2 different json files from the SDAI module in temporal order, which are called `phase1` and `phase2` respectively.
